        "Review": "MIT offers an unparalleled academic experience with world-class faculty, cutting-edge research, and a collaborative culture. The opportunities for innovation, networking, and career advancement are exceptional. I particularly appreciated the supportive community and access to state-of-the-art facilities. However, the rigorous workload can be overwhelming, and balancing academics with personal life is challenging. Financial aid is generous but could be more inclusive for middle-income families. Overall, MIT fosters an environment for driven individuals to excel and make an impact. It’s ideal for those passionate about solving real-world problems, but prospective students should be prepared for its intensity and high expectations.",

The academic rigor here is unmatched; classes are fast-paced and intellectually stimulating, pushing you to think critically and creatively. The professors are not only experts in their fields but also genuinely invested in their students’ success. \n\nCollaboration is a core aspect of MIT culture, and I love working alongside brilliant peers who inspire me to think outside the box. The resources available—from cutting-edge labs to research opportunities—are incredible. \n\nOutside the classroom, the vibrant campus life offers a variety of clubs, events, and hackathons, ensuring there’s never a dull moment. While the workload can be intense, the support system among students and faculty is phenomenal. Overall, MIT is a place where passion meets innovation, making it an unforgettable journey.",

My professors have always been available and the opportunity to apply my studies and skills to research projects was great.   My fellow student are good people and everyone in have met has some kind of truly unique capability.  I have learned that being in the top 99% of GPA and test scores is great, but I routinely meet people in the top 99.5% and they seem many times smarter than me.  Being around people like this keep me humble and motived.  I like party scene, as I can alway find something fun to do whenever time allows.  I also like that most of my colleagues are not trying to 'look' smart...and anyone who would try this would soon find that someone right next to them is many time more capable.

Not pretty (to say the least). You definitely have to go out of your way to find fun things on campus— fun does not come to you. Some students have a hard time at MIT, especially mentally.

I met a few friends here and there, and slowly realized that I am not alone. We all just opened a new chapter of our lives, eager to see where it would lead. And the only way to truly cherish this chapter was to do it together. So we did. We went to lectures together, marvelling at our professor's world renowned research. We attempted problem sets together, struggling with questions of difficulty we hadn't seen before. We walked across the bridge to Boston together, exploring the new city we began to call home. We laughed in our dorm rooms, joking with new friends and roommates. We partied on the weekends, celebrating the end of a stressful week. We studied hard in the library late at night until we fell asleep. MIT taught me that I don't have to do this alone--I'm not supposed to. My friends, my family, my community... WE do this together.",

The opportunity to learn from some of the most distinguished professors and work with bright, ambitious peers is unparalleled.\n\nThe curriculum is rigorous and challenging, which I appreciate as it pushes students to their intellectual limits. MIT's focus on combining theory with practical application is particularly engaging. For example, not only did I learn the theory behind machine learning algorithms, but I also got to implement these algorithms to solve real-world problems. This hands-on approach is what sets MIT apart from many other institutions.\n\nFurthermore, MIT's culture of innovation and entrepreneurship is highly motivating. The environment encourages students to think outside the box, fostering an innovative mindset. It's also commonplace for undergraduates to work in research labs, contributing to groundbreaking advancements in various fields.",

While classes are intense, I found my peers to be extremely willing to help and work through our homework together. I never felt like I couldn't ask for help from my friends. Between professors and classmates, you'll find a very supportive environment and collaborative culture. In terms of social life, I was surprised by how much MITers like to party and socialize. Unlike other universities, most of the party scene is in the fraternities (>50% of MIT men are affiliated in Greek life). Majority of students live on-campus, or in independent living groups close to campus, which creates a really tight-knit community feel with campus. A few things I would like to see change are MIT Admin's focus on student life and amenities. Over my years at MIT, there were many issues regarding dorms shutting down, facilities being outdated (e.g., student center). Would love to see more investment in student life in the future",

The campus is extremely welcoming and you really get to be who you want to be; it's very beautiful. Each dorm has an extant history and culture; you can automatically learn about someone by what dorm they live in.\n\nThe academics are exceedingly difficult by content and pace.

This can go two ways - you can fall victim to imposter syndrome (believing you don't belong, you're not good enough) or you can rise to the occasion and leverage your peers and upperclassmen friends. That is what makes MIT - the people here are unlike people you've ever met. They're supportive, helpful, passionate, and they CARE about you more than you think. MIT is a tough place and it will put you in your place, but it does that to everyone. The playing field is even, there's no grading on a \"curve\" and we're not too competitive with each other (when it comes to classes). Your friends will help you with psets, career advise, clubs, and everything else - just as you would help them too. MIT is its own beautiful community with a home for everyone.",

I majored in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (essentially neuroscience) and minored in Anthropology. I adored both of those departments - the classes, the teachers, the admins, the research opportunities. I know some other majors like chemical engineering are more difficult and aren't quite as adored by their students. \n\nIf you ask a student what there favorite part about MIT is, 90% of the time they will say the people. Being a specialized and somewhat quirky school, students at MIT have so much in common. Usually, that commonality is a passion to make a difference, openmindedness/acceptance, and a desire to play hard when not studying. Our student groups are varied and vibrant and our party scene is known as the best in Boston, but ultimately, we thrive on our close-knit community and appreciation for one another.",

I have been challenged in every way, and it has made a stronger person coming out of the other side. I have made some of the best friends here and met some of the smartest and most interesting people as well. Coming out of sophomore year I had never felt more inadequate, I was a B-C student for the first time in my life, failed a class, and got rejected from a dozen companies. When I finally landed an internship I went in expecting to be woefully unprepared based on my class performance. That's when I realized that struggling at MIT was flying anywhere else. The real workforce felt so easy and I barely felt challenged even as I got assigned to more and more projects. MIT's the first place that made me feel stupid, but it also made me realize that comparing myself to others is a terrible way to measure success and that I needed to be the best I could be (which compared to the rest of the world was pretty good.) In short. IHTFP (both meanings).",

The academic environment tends to undervalue these fields, but the people in them, especially in SHASS (School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) really care about their fields. The main thing I'd change about MIT, and have been trying to change for the past 3 years, is out culture around suffering. Many students wear their suffering as a badge of pride and vie to work the most, sleep the least, and be most 'hosed,' from firehose. We devalue mental health and self-care, and students often think others will look down on them for asking for help. Those facets of MIT need to change, but I've seen people at the Institute who care and are working on this, so I have very much hope for the future of my school.",

I was a linguistics major in the Linguistics and Philosophy department, so I was Course 24-2. Our program rocks 'cause MIT, unbeknownst to many, is one of the best institutions for theoretical linguistics. (We have the grandfather of modern linguistics, Noam Chomsky, and many other fine linguists such as David Pesetsky, Irene Heim, Martin Hackl, Norvin Richards, and Kenneth Wexler, just to name a few). Unfortunately, the program is very small (as is the graduate program) and does not get as much attention as it should, both from the students and the faculty. The graduate program is extremely renowned and highly competitive. But, back to the undergraduate program, yes, it is small. In fact, my graduating class probably only had around 5-7 (out of a class of around 1000) doing linguistics (or philosophy, both are in the same department) as their primary major. As such, I went through classes without meeting some of these kids. And contrary to the norm at MIT, which is built on collaboration, I'd often have to do my psets (problem sets = homework) alone since very few people were taking my classes.",

A relentless workload,  grades that don't reflect the amount of effort I put into studying, and brutal weather for about 3/4 of the year.

MIT is like no other place in the world and you need to find a close group of friends, with diverse backgrounds, in order to make it through.  We struggle together and help one another through the hard times, but also celebrate and have fun together.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the professors at MIT, for the most part, truly care about their students and go out of the way to get to know them and assist them.  Once you get into your major classes, the class sizes are small and become close-knit, not only with the other students, but also with the professors.\r\n\r\nMIT Greek life is extremely different than any other Greek life I've experienced.  Almost half the campus is Greek.  But it is not full of drama but developing a support network to get through MIT.\r\n\r\nThe students at MIT feel free to let themselves shine.  Although they are swamped with work, they still find time to devote hours to dancing, to varsity sports, to building roller coasters in front of their dorms, to helping their community, and to hacking.  The students are incredibly well-rounded and, surprisingly, not very competitive.  They tend to strive to be their personal bests instead of competing with others.",

The workload is hard, some days it feels like the workload is just crushing. But, if you can keep your head up and work through it and get help when you need, it is quite an awesome experience. If I had to pick colleges again, I would still choose to come to MIT.",

        "Review": "Challenging Yet Rewarding – If you are ready for a challenge academically, but still want to have a good college experience, this is the perfect place.  You will meet some the most amazing people and learn so much over your years here.  You can play sports, be in a sorority or fraternity, and do well in school and have a life if you budget your time well enough.  It was the perfect place for me.",
