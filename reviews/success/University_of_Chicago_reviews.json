            "Review": "Overall, University of Chicago stood up to the title 'second home'.  Although I had some challenges to overcome, they maintained my scholarship throughout the years, were home to all 6 years of scholarship experience (2 high school, 4 undergrad), and had experienced, dedicated professors.  What needs work is the advisors.  The college advisors assigned to me knew essentially nothing about what was the best path for me to earn my major.  They overall served as more of a roadblock.  The best resource I delt with was the student advisor in the department of the major I was interested in.  The general advisors helped me put together an undoable class schedule, while the department specific advisor knew what courses were best to take earlier vs. later, and what courses not to put together in the same quarter.",

As a student it will be important to seek out more opportunities and definitely get to know your professors as this will open more doors post graduation. There are activities and clubs for everyone, so don't be afraid to get involved. The social dynamics at Uchicago at what you make of it and if you find that you don't always get along with dorm mates, definitely join clubs to expand your social pool.",

However, the social aspect (at least for me) feels very lackluster due to house culture not really being what it was hyped up to be and the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for students like myself to socialize and try to make new connections. I would definitely like to see a renewed push to promote house culture so students could be more involved with it on a regular basis, have new clubs open up that solely seek to promote socializing among students of similar academic dispositions or interests (like it would be great if there was a History Club that focused entirely on discussing history, watching documentaries, doing activities, etc.).",

Everyone I’ve met—from my professors and classmates to the members of the organizations I’ve joined—has been incredibly supportive and inspiring. The collaborative environment here has made my transition much easier and has allowed me to grow both personally and academically.\n\nOne thing I’d like to see change is the transfer credit policy. While I understand the university's rigorous standards, the process of evaluating transfer credits can be frustrating. It would be great to have more transparency and flexibility in how prior coursework is recognized, especially since transfer students often come in with valuable experiences and knowledge from other institutions.",

The professors I have met so far all appear to be enthusiastic about their specific fields, and they can be especially helpful outside of class. Given that our campus is located within a neighborhood, there are plenty of community activities and restaurants that students can hang out at, such as a Mexican-Korean restaurant called Seoul Taco. There are multiple dormitory buildings on campus, and the southern one is especially convenient as it has a dining hall, gym, and a small store all in one general place. There are also plenty of clubs, called RSOs, ranging from many types of activities like boxing or Japanese drum practice (Taiko). I would like more transportation options to explore.",

            "Review": "UChicago Academically is amazing! If you decide to be an athlete here beware! Coaches don't care about your school work.  They over train you and occupy too much of your time. The coach I had has been there for 20+ years and does not care about winning he only cares about how much money our program brings to the school.  The second you graduate he is guilting you into donating. I learned a lot at UChicago, the study abroad programs are great. I landed a great job and would attend again, but would reconsider playing sports.",

Any degree and major here will challenge you to grow as a learner, no matter what career path you choose.

For example, UChicago provides an extremely bolstered career advancement system, by helping in bringing students up to speed about applications and preparing them for post-college employment. Additionally, the community around me is unique and diverse– I have enjoyed connecting with students from all around the country, if not the world. Lastly, the campus is extremely accessible, in terms of downtown transportation, and it is beautiful. Walking through the quad at dusk or at night never gets old.",

The students here are supportive, and the culture (academic and social) is so inclusive. Even beyond the undergraduate student body, professors and graduate students jump to include undergrads in their conversations, projects, and spaces. Most importantly to me, however, was the emphasis on critical thought and citizenship. In our core sequences, we read primary texts almost exclusively, developing our ability to form opinions; and the rigorous system of general education requirements that comprises the core ensures we are conversant in all disciplines, allowing us to critically interpret news and current events as well.",

Especially in the first year of college, balancing classes with taking care of health and getting used to living on your own can be a challenge, although with pre-orientation programs, the University seems like it's trying to make that transition smoother. There are a lot of resources available (career, academic advising, etc.) but sometimes can be hard to access. For example, my academic advisor has changed 6 times in 3 years which has made it hard to build a consistent relationship, but I've been able to find mentorship elsewhere. Made a lot of good friends though, mostly later on in college so don't worry if you don't feel like you're meeting \"your people\" early on!",

I've gone ice skating with them, thrift shopping, we've played midnight soccer, had just-dance competitions, watched cringy rom-coms and just stayed up talking until 3am.

UChicago does not have the same brand-recognition as other schools,  but the people who make decisions on employment in the hardest fields to break into know how good this school is and how thoroughly it prepares you.

My seminars have been full of rich discussions and many professors have became intellectual mentors of mine. Outside of the classroom, nerdy and serious discussions rarely stop. Dorms, dining halls, and student groups are breeding grounds for philosophical debate, historical trivia, and calculus equations. I am a student government leader and president of the Israeli cultural society. Despite our reputation of where fun goes to die, I have had an unending series of opportunities to lead and grow. People at UChicago accept you for who you are. This school has been an incredible source of personal growth and one I will be sad to leave this Spring.",

Otherwise, it is actually more fun and social than its reputation lets on, and the campus is beautiful.

If not, it's possible to have a relatively normal student life. Teaching is for the most part good, though there are some exceptions (in my experience STEM classes taught by grad students aren't a great time.) But course reviews are a great help with that.\n\nThe size of the student body is perfect—easy enough to find people you already know, but large enough that most are open to making new friends. Lots of fun little traditions. Taking small things that few people know/care about extremely seriously is a key part of the experience.\n\nGorgeous campus.

Although the University of Chicago preaches inclusion and diversity, they don't seem to do nearly enough. Overall, UofC feels like a privileged bubble. More than that, instead of trying to incorporate and help the South Side community, UofC continuously gentrifies and uses the excuse of 'student safety' to expand their control on the South.

Everyone in Uchicago has something interesting about them and they can teach you plenty about whatever niche topic they are interested in. The professors are kind and understanding, they have definitely helped me gain new perspectives and helped me feel inspired. Everyone at this school is honestly super smart and capable and overall the people I have met are good people",

            "Review": "The school experience ar UChicago is very good for students. Financial aid packages are generous, and housing is excellent. The workload at the University is manageable, but often comes in waves of very intense periods during Midterm season and final season, followed by periods of very little or no work at all. I dislike this, but some students enjoy it. Uchicago's core curriculum system is intense, requiring 15 mandatory classes regardless of your major (18 if you speak only one language). It takes about a year and a half of dedicated focus to complete. The core, though, has been an essential part of my intellectual ferment. Social sciences in particular are far more in depth at UChicago than at say, Dartmouth or Yale (based on my friends' testimonies). Overall, the school has issues, but they're minor. it's a great school.\n\n\n the Maroon dollar program lets students get $300 resteraunt-quality food each year. The cafeteria food is free, available at most times of day, and fine.",

Being located in South Side Chicago, some may be understandably wary of safety concerns, but having one of the largest private campus police forces definitely helps. Entering into Hyde Park and specifically onto campus is almost like entering into a different world from the surrounding cityscape. The quad is beautiful year round - with frosted buildings in the winter and vibrant \n flowers and vegetation in the spring. Of course, the academic burden is rigorous but also rewarding. Surprising for me, was just how helpful the career advancement office was. As for a social life, when the library is one of the most hype social spaces on campus it's clear that absolute ragers aren't a top priority. You might get a few gems though...rarely. Best to find your social circle and make the most of it. Nearly half a decade with a close-knit squad can be very rewarding.",

Therefore, it has this very unique, cerebral culture, and that means student life looks different here. The best thing about this place is that everyone is passionate about something, usually many things, and that shows in the many different student groups that exist. Professors are usually also full of passion for  their subject. Also, with UChicago being internationally known, it draws students, professors, and guests from around the country and world, meaning your opportunities to meet people and to be at the forefront of many conversations are almost unparalleled. However, you have to deal with an obscenely high price tag and an administration that is uncommunicative, uncaring, and makes life very difficult for students.

I have found that the dividends and rewards only increase with time; it left me with the ability to think critically - to separate truth from fiction, to understand others' reasoning, to contemplate ways to separate and attack problems - a skill that is proving invaluable in my career. I'm a recent graduate, and I found that the academics were unparalleled and that I met amazing amazing people at the school - my closest friends are all fellow Chicago alums who are now around the globe pursuing their interests and passions to the highest level.",

There's so many opportunities available to students and every person I've met has had something interesting about them. Of course, there's a heavy workload but it makes you grow so much intellectually. I've learned and absorbed more in the past year than in the ten before it.",

The Core Curriculum introduces truly applicable frameworks for critical thinking that can the applied in a diverse curriculum.  At UChicago you can attend your Physics lecture in the morning, work on your film project until you participate in a religious discussion in the afternoon and rehearse with your traditional African music group in the evening. In spite of the lack of affordability, UChicago does offer various ways of financing, including generous financial aid and merit-based scholarships. However, Uchicago is not need bling to international applicants, which is likely to discourage low-income international students to apply.",

There are definitely some smart people here, and I enjoy a lot of my classes, but this place is a hotbed of depression, suicide, racism, and elitist morons.

Classes are challenging yet still engaging. Peers love to engage in intellectual discussions. Dining hall is pretty good and housing is excellent.

The faculty are all so invested in their teaching, and it is reflected in the amount of availability there is outside of class to meet and discuss assignments or concepts from class. Career services is also really helpful in prepping for interviews and touching up resumes, so if you engage with their office, you have a leg up in any job search. Playing sports here is an interesting pursuit, as I play on the basketball team, and although it is an awesome experience, there is little student support.

I have learned so much academically, taking classes including Advanced Computational Modeling for Biology, Organic Chemistry, Introduction to Language Development, and Introduction to World Music. I have learned to think, to take risks, to consider questions I wouldn't have otherwise explored. Being at UChicago has also allowed me to immerse myself in the South Side community as my House's Civic Engagement Representative.",

            "Review": "The University of Chicago uses its gigantic private police force to selectively enforce the laws that protect rather than inconvenience its students.  Chicago police are far too busy to come on our campus much.  The UCPD doesn't care at all about students drinking, partying, or using drugs, as long as they aren't also destroying property or committing some other more serious crime.  UCPD officers see kids smoke marijuana all the time, for example.  The neighborhood around campus is absolutely crawling with UCPD officers after about 9 or 10 PM, which is understandable given the campus is very close to Englewood and other rougher areas, but it's a little weird seeing a car parked on every block.  The surveillance is extensive and a little unnerving, but again, they aren't in it to arrest students, just protect them.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of alcohol use in the dorms, it's allowed under certain fairly lax conditions, and even if those aren't met, real consequences are few and far between.  Some students have been kicked out of housing for dealing illegal drugs, but that's pretty understandable, and the policy within dorms is generally very easygoing.  I've had drunk conversations with my RA and RH while I was underage, for example.",

In my experience I have no idea who is who unless I'm friends with them, but perhaps the experience is different for others. \r\n\r\nEthnic heritage - There are large Asian and Jewish populations on campus. There also seem to be a good number of Indian-Americans. I'm sure you can find stats on ethnicity breakdown. I haven't noticed any segregation along ethnic lines among social groups, but I could be naive. \r\n\r\nPolitical affiliation - As with almost all campuses, the student body is largely liberal. That said, the majority of students are not involved in politics and probably wouldn't care all that much if you were conservative. There is a College Republicans group, I'm not sure how well-attended it is, but they do exist.\r\n\r\nReligious background - I'm sure the majority of the student body would identify as non-religious, but there are certainly populations that adhere to the major religions and there are services available if you're interested. \r\n\r\nSexual orientation - There's a decent-sized LGBT community here, and people are pretty open about it. I haven't experienced any homophobia, but then again I'm straight so I probably wouldn't.",

If you want to be involved in greek life: join a frat, go to frat parties, etc. then it definitely exists and is somewhat popular.

As such, the alcohol and drug policy is one of the most relaxed I've heard of. Parties only get broken up due to volume, and I've never heard of any real consequences.  Your house likely won't care if you have alcohol as long as it stays in the rooms, and even that policy is often ignored. As for as drugs outside of alcohol, the policy gets more strict the harder the drug. The school does little to police marijuana; people will smoke relatively openly outside without any problems. I've heard of the occasional police incident, but nothing beyond throwing out the drugs and absolutely no real problems. Harder drugs are around and policed as necessary, but as long as you're keeping it to yourself and friends, there will still likely be no problems. The UChicago Police is a constant presence, but they're basically there to make sure you don't die; they don't care what you do as long as you're safe. Thus, drug policy is simply a \"pay no heed unless we have to\" ideal.",

In terms of interests, people here really run the gamut. A lot of people are into TV shows like the Wire, the Daily Show, or Breaking Bad, and almost everyone plays IM sports with their house.",

In the dorms, the RAs are really chill and there isn't actually a formal way to get \"written up,\" for alcohol or anything, although they still expect you to try and behave responsibly (most people do, even if drinking). The campus police are great with students. they may show up to a loud party in a fraternity or an apartment but they will rarely do anything beyond telling people to go home.",

However, Greek Life at UChicago is definitely something to appreciate. It's relatively small, however, they're a huge part of campus nightlife and social life. Unlike many other schools, there isn't a sharp, obnoxious divide between Greeks and non-Greeks. Going Greek (or not going Greek) is a personal choice, and isn't something that defines someone's entire life here. Overall, Greek life is so fun. You meet a lot of people you wouldn't come across otherwise, and being part of a smaller community is nice. It's pretty tight-knit, so for those who are a part of it, it's like having a mini-community of awesome people within the wider university.",

However, all around - in terms of race, interests, geographic locations, personalities - UChicago has a great variety of students. There's not a single prevailing type of student that may  be found at other schools.

There's a decent (but not great) selection of poli sci courses offered each quarter, but the requirements are really easy to fulfill so it isn't like you need to take one each quarter if there aren't any you like. It's basically just any 12 poli sci classes you want (although I've heard rumblings they may be making stricter requirements for future years). The professors are generally quite good and the top of their field. I'd recommend classes with Lipson, Rosenberg, and Pape (he's kind of a vain, but he's really interesting) when they're offered. They started an Institute of Politics last year that brings in speakers pretty regularly, so that's a great resource if you're interested in politics. Theoretically they also help get poli sci internships, I haven't seen much evidence of that though. \r\n\r\nPublic Policy is smaller (although growing, I think). It's like a more rigorous poli sci, and you can double count four of the classes for poli sci too, so it makes a very easy double major. You have to take specific classes in math, econ, and stats, as well as specific public policy courses, but the classes are generally pretty good.",

Many classes in the humanities and social sciences will count toward your degree, and you get exposure to many fields. You also MUST study abroad during the course of the program, which is a valuable experience. The head of the department is also a great professor who really likes to talk to students and be involved. However, this major requires a lot of self-direction because of how loose it is, and many students don't acquire that skill. Administratively, it's quite unorganized and it can be a pain to find classes if you are not interested in either human rights or NGOs/development.\r\n\r\nPublic Policy: Another loosely organized major, though with more requirements than IS. Many classes in the social sciences and economics will count toward it. The major really helps you understand the workings behind real world policy decisions/institutions and gives you a more nuanced understanding of current events. The major includes a practicum where you practice research skills and policy writing. However, it can be an administrative nightmare as well because of the open-endedness of the major.",

Yes, there have been a few professors that I meshed with better than others, but no matter what, they have all been extremely supportive and willing to help/discuss things further outside of class, and they are all clearly at the top of their respective fields.  What I love most about UChicago is its overall academic philosophy--the idea that learning should be for the sake of learning.  Of course we're all still fairly career-oriented, but we know that the best way to get there is to truly get a comprehensive education and fully understand that which we are studying.  For example, in the long run, doesn't it make more sense to be an Economics major [especially at U of C] than to just be a \"Marketing\" major at some other school [which is fairly limiting]?",

The core sequence is typically taught by grad students, but they really know their stuff and are willing to help. The email internship/job listhosts are also very helpful for job searches. The program is very well-respected, and the U of C brand name generally helps a resume stand out.",

Once you have found a connection, though, the networking possibilities that come out of it are excellent.

            "Review": "I was almost a straight A student in high school, graduating as part of the top 5% of scholars in California. My interest in medicine prompted me to choose biology as my major with hopes of going to medical school. However, the grade deflation at this school is so harsh that many say that it is unrealistic for pre-medical students from the University of Chicago to go to medical students matching their skills. That is to say, many people on the pre-medical track at my school would rather now transfer to a different perhaps less prestigious school in exchange for classes with lower workloads and less grade deflation. Moreover, the workload is overwhelming in that over 50 kids dropped out of my general chemistry class. Overall, I would never recommend our school to pre-medical students. If i had to choose any benefits I got from this school on my track to medical school though, it would definitely be the vast number of research opportunities so easily obtainable; not to mention that often times the research opportunity you would get at this school will most likely be under a renown professor.",

I have had nationally known professors teach me in Chemistry courses (Yamamoto) and Comparative Human Development course (Margaret Spencer).  The curriculum can be abstract at times.  It is a research oriented institutions so factual knowledge is not fostered much.  \r\nThis is the place for inquisitive and exploratory minds.  The coursework and workload can be difficult and rigorous, but no matter what type of education you are seeking you are sure to get the best research oriented education post secondary education has to offer.",

            "Review": "Great Resources for Students Looking to Advance Their Studies – Chicago gives its students incredible freedom to pursue academic aspirations at a level that goes beyond just discussing the textbooks.  This university has serious street cred in many fields, such as sociology, archeology, chemistry, biology, astronomy, the humanities, and economics.  \r\n\r\nOne thing that a lot of students have in common with the faculty who teach them is that they like to delve into topics slightly off the beaten path.  Some students think, \"Wouldn't it be great if I did ...\"  If you make a good proposal, most likely you can do it here or with the college's blessing.  If you want to spend a summer at an NGO overseas, there's a college grant for that.  And if you want to discover lost species in the Gobi desert or observe older regions of the galaxy, this place can help you do that, too. Or maybe you know a bit about finance but you're interested specifically in art auctions, pricing what are priceless paintings.  These are all examples of neat things that people I've known have done while attending the U of C. The Core curriculum is important, but it's not as rigid as it might sound.  An important part of the \"typical\" Chicago education is the exploration of the not-so-typical.\r\n  \r\nThere is a lot more to Chicago life than academics, of course.  The student community is fairly small and cozy, and activities hosted by one organization or another (even Greek parties) are generally open to everyone in the campus community. Although the courses stress academic criticism, people are considerate (especially in debate) and the students love games. The epic scavenger hunt that goes on every spring demonstrates that fun is alive and well.",

On the south side of campus, the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts just opened this past fall and boasts several music practice rooms, a woodshop, a state-of-the-art performance hall, and daily music and art events.

Additionally, UChicago's career advancement programs have really expanded over the past few years--the Jeff Metcalf program now offers more than 500 paid summer internships for its students.

It is a rigorous academic institution with a somewhat accelerated schedule due to the quarter system, but there are many opportunities to get involved in campus life through student organizations, community service, and the activities that students come up with themselves to spice things up. One of the things that has really caught on is the school wide game/contest scene. It borrows on the structure of one of the hallmark traditions called \"Scav\", which is a dorm-team scavenger hunt where you make the things on \"the list\". These other games like Assassins and Humans vs. Zombies organized by students make things interesting on the quad and in the dorms.",

There really is something for everybody here, whether you are interested in Greek life, sports, community service, or just really focused on your studies. It is easy to get a job on campus (even if you are not a work-study student), and people are really genuinely welcoming when you get to campus (even the upperclassmen). The Metcalf internships over the summer are amazing - you can do what would pretty much always be an unpaid internship over the summer, but you get a stipend to live off of while you do the internship, so you can actually make money!",

There isn't grade inflation here, so you will work for your A, although it is still possible to get one (or many) if you're willing to put in the effort.  You'll come out with a really unparalleled academic experience in my opinion. Outside of class, PEOPLE DO REALLY HAVE FUN!! This is not the kind of school where \"fun\" is 60,000 people tailgating a football game, but if you want to have great conversations, an awesome housing community, lots of interesting things to do (clubs, large events like Scav Hunt or cultural shows, and hey, anything that the awesome city of Chicago has for you to do, and some parties) this is the perfect place to be.

Lots of museums and other attractions have student free days, restaurants have student discounts, and because there is such a high density of colleges and universities in the cities (and then northwestern just in the suburbs) there's a large crowd of 18-23 year olds to hang out with. The city is also great because especially during the warmer months, there are tons of free things to do (free museum days, music festivals, art expos etc). The shopping ranges from pretty high end (like the 900 on north michigan/boutiques on mag mile) to thrift stores around Pilsen and Uptown. There's a big sports culture here, with the Sox, Cubs, Blackhawks, Bears, Bulls and Fire being a big part of the Chicago city pride. Students aside, Chicago is a very culturally diverse town with tons of little cultural neighborhoods that are great to visit as well. Unlike other cities like say, New York, it's not as elitist, rushed, crowded or dirty. CTA transport is extremely affordable, and ZipCar and the local iGo car sharing services make travel around the city easy too.

            "Review": "Winter Is Too Long – I'm from Florida, so I thought I might turn into an icicle. The winter really isn't that bad, as long as you have the proper coat, boots, scarves and gloves. The worst part about the winter is how dark it gets.  The sun sets around 4 pm and it's really depressing. It's also annoying that the winter lasts so long.  When it's snowing in April, you feel like the world hates you. But then, spring comes and the flowers bloom and the trees turn green and it's beautiful and magical and life is good! Fall is also really nice because it's not too cold and the leaves turn, so the quad is ablaze with orange, gold, and red. The first few snows are really fun, and there tend to be snowball fights on the quad. When the snow freezes into muddy ice, then it's not as fun. But, there are plenty of fun campus activities in the winter to keep you distracted.",

We have a bunch of libraries to choose from: The Harper Reading room looks like it should be a Harry Potter film set, the Reg is ugly and somewhat depressing but you get a lot of work done (and you can see the Chicago skyline from the 5th floor). The Mansueto (aka Man Sweat aka Bibliodome aka RegEgg) just opened and is sleek and modern, and Crerar is great too. The libraries are always clean and well maintained. \r\nThe gyms are great too, especially Ratner. It has an olympic-sized indoor pool, basketball courts, dance practice rooms, weightlifting and other exercise equipment, and plenty of treadmills and elliptical machines... so many that I've never had to wait for one to be free. Henry Crown gym is a bit older and run down, but has an indoor track and even more treadmills and exercise machines, and is conveniently located between two dining halls. \r\nThe Reynolds club (student center) has the beautiful Mandel Hall, where large performances take place, and also the third floor theater for smaller performances. It is also home to the UChicago seal (don't step on it) and an Einstein Brothers cafe. The cafe sells huge, delicious $1 milkshakes every Wednesday and there is a beautiful courtyard where you can slurp them up on warm days. \r\nIn general, campus is beautiful. The main quad is especially Hogwarts-like. I love the Gothic architecture and in the fall the colorful leaves on the trees are just so picturesque! \r\nClassrooms are fine for the most part, some are a little small and some buildings don't have air conditioning, which is fine for most of the year but gets pretty miserable around May.\r\nOverall though, this place is SO BEAUTIFUL!",

It snows a lot, but the campus actually does a very good job with the shoveling and salting of sidewalks.  Even in the blizzard of 2011, the sidewalks were clear enough to walk on.",

The Art Institute is incredible, and UChicago students get free admission. The Lincoln Park Zoo is another cool free attraction, and many museums (such as the Field Museum) have free days at least once a month. Hyde Park, the neighborhood where UChicago is located, is not quite as awesome. Everything closes at 9 or 10 pm, so if you get hungry late on a Saturday night, your options are Walgreens (open 24 hrs) or Bartmart (the campus convenience store)... Pretty slim pickings. There aren't really people out and about doing things, unless it's an event on campus. I recommend you escape to the city as often as possible!",

With the $60,000+ price tag, really think about if it's worth it. You will have a great education, but the stress, social environment, and cost may not be worth it.",

I will say that I was on multiple occasions told something about financial aid or promised something by one person, and then another person in the university would contradict what I had been told earlier.  I think this goes for ANY school you apply to: EVERY SINGLE TIME you talk to ANYONE about financial aid, write down their name, the date, and a quick summary of what they say.  Then say it back to them and ask them if this is correct.  That way you keep a record of what you're told or promised.",

The only real grocery store in Hyde Park is Treasure Island, which is huge and has lots of options but is again overpriced and also fairly far from campus.

The Kosher station is the best by far, not sure why, but I go there pretty often. There is also Starbucks coffee, soda, juices, and tea in the dining hall. The quality is ok...sometimes it's pretty bad but sometimes it surprises me in a good way! I like that there's always salad and fruit options so I feel like I can eat healthily. Also the flex dollars (Maroon Dollars) can be used at the on-campus Subway, mini-marts, Einstein bagels, and various other cafes (lots of great coffee places!), which proves to be useful.",

            "Review": "Living off campus is generally much cheaper than living on campus, but you have to do a lot more - find a place, maintain it yourself, cook for yourself, be an adult.  Availability is good, through both older students moving out and directly calling the landlords.  Mac Apartments is the dominant landlord, and they have a lot of nice places but are known to not respond very quickly to maintenance issues.  Some apartments have heating issues, which is a HUGE problem in the winter and is something you really need to check for when you're looking for a new place.  Blackstone Management has some prime real-estate right between campus and the 53rd Street shopping corridor (they dominate the 54th and Woodlawn corner); they are better about maintenance and have nice apartments, but they can be a bit strange.  \r\n\r\nThere are certain areas where the vast majority of apartment units are rented by students - immediately east and north of campus.  These areas are generally fairly safe, but if you go west of Drexel or south of 62nd, you will enter much more dangerous neighborhoods and lots of crime, which sometimes spills over into student areas.  Break-ins and muggings happen to students multiple times a year.  \r\n\r\nAlmost every apartment has the same basic layout - a long hallway with rooms off one side and a kitchen at the end.  Almost every building has three floors, two apartments per floor.  This makes off-campus housing kind of boring - if you've seen one apartment, you pretty much know what all of them look like.",

Uchicago is great about not really being strict and affording you the freedoms of an adult as long as you stay safe, which is nice compared to my friend's at other schools who can't have people of the opposite sex come into their room or can't engage in certain activities without being afraid of being arrested.

They aren't actually that bad, people just like complaining. Finding housing can be a bit of a pain, you just have to keep your eye out online and ask MAC to show you available units. I ended up getting one of the few apartments in Hyde Park that isn't owned by MAC, and I can't say my landlord is sunshine and rainbows, but it's not the biggest deal.\r\n\r\nI've never heard of someone not finding an apartment in Hyde Park, so availability isn't really an issue. As far as convenience, your natural instinct is to try and get an apartment within a couple blocks of campus, but it really isn't a big deal to be further out as long as you're Northeast/East of Campus. They have 3 buses that travel around Hyde Park and drop off on or near campus, so you'll never be more than 3 or so blocks from a bus stop. \r\n\r\nCost-wise, it will vary. If you want a studio or one bedroom it will probably be pricier, probably $700-$800. If you have multiple bedrooms it gets cheaper. I'm in a four bedroom and we pay $2100 ($525 ea), but that's probably on the slightly lower end. I'd say average is about $600/mo.",

Apartment arrangements are also incredibly flexible due to the sheer volume of students constantly moving in and out.

            "Review": "House Pride! UChicago's housing system ensures a tight knit community. In addition to being placed in a dorm, you're placed in a house, a group of 50-100 students in your dorm. These are the people you'll hang out with all year, whether you spend the evening studying together, go downtown for dinner or a movie, or check out events on campus.",

            "Review": "Max Palevsky – First, it should be acknowledged that Max P does in fact have hideous architecture with all the rooms being uniform as either a single or double suite. Luckily though, the rest of the building is an effort to combat these negative qualities: The location is close to campus which is further advantaged by an underground tunnel system that allows you to see others in neighboring Max P dorms without having to step outside. In the summer/fall it's air conditioned and the heat is plentiful in the winter. Excellent water pressure, very clean, and still relatively new.",

The facility itself is less than 10 years old, and though a little ugly, is clean and comfortable. Having your own bathroom in your room is a huge plus.",

After living in the dorms for a year, many opt to live off-campus. Most of the apartments are old and need much work. They are, however, close to campus, near shuttle routes that can bring students to and from campus, and decently priced.",

There are parties for those that want them along with groups of people who love to just stay in and play video games. Sometimes on campus activities can get pretty repetitive but going downtown is just as accessible as any other place on campus.",

            "Review": "Dorms at UChicago are pretty great.  I stayed in Max Palevsky, which is right by the dining halls, the main quad, and the gym.  My Resident Heads were really chill, and there are almost no rules when it comes to drinking in the dorms, which is very different from other universities with strict policies.  It's nice that the students are trusted to do their own thing.  \r\n\r\nMax Palevsky is also one of the most social dorms.  Other social dorms are South Campus and Pierce.  South Campus is further away, however, and Pierce is old and doesn't have air-conditioning.  Then there are dorms like BJ and Snell-Hitchcock, which is where the weirder, more \"UChicago\" type people go.  They seem to love it there, but those dorms are older as well.  There are also some dorms like Blackstone, which is super far away and nobody knows anyone who actually lives there.  In my opinion, Max is definitely the best choice.",

In this case, it is especially true if one wishes to live north of campus, in the safer areas. However, the money paid for safety is absolutely worth the extra cost, and most of the apartments are well-kept.",

            "Review": "A Dorm for Every Personality – Firstly, the house system is outstanding, and is especially great for first-years by providing a small close-knit group of people.  Secondly, the dorms are as eclectic as the personalities at this school. You have historic, Gothic, Hogwarts-esque dorms like Snell-Hitchcock; the huge newfangled glass one, South Campus; the orange Lego brick in the middle of campus, Max Pavlevsky; and so on. Although the newest dorms have the nicest features, each older one has its own \"character\" (in both a good and bad sense). In general, each dorm has positives and negatives which balance each other out, as shown by by the fact that everyone is proud of their own dorm and house.",
