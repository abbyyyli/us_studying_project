Social scene revolved completely around Greek life until senior year since everyone had to live on campus. Athletics were pretty bad save for baseball, but that’s not why you go to Vanderbilt. Nashville is a fun town and campus is just a short drive from downtown.",

There is a lot of freedom in the classes that I can enroll in, making it easy to take on multiple majors or minors, which many students take advantage of. Vanderbilt makes sure to offer its students several financial and academic resources. I hope to see improvements in the administration listening to the student body though, and moving to uplift everyone instead of oppressing us and the institution’s issues.",

The campus is beautiful, the professors are caring, and Nashville is a fun city to live in.\n\nOne of the best things about Vanderbilt is the professors. They are not just experts in their fields; they genuinely care about their students. Professors at Vanderbilt have open-door policies, making it easy for students to get help when they need it. Also, academics at Vanderbilt are top-notch, with a wide range of programs and interdisciplinary opportunities. The curriculum is challenging and prepares students well for their future careers. Hands-on research and experiential learning opportunities enrich the academic experience. Nashville, known as \"Music City,\" offers a vibrant music scene, nightlife, restaurants, and cultural attractions. The city is a hub for healthcare, technology, music, and entertainment, providing internships and job opportunities for students.",

The campus is a vibrant hub of diversity, where students from all walks of life come together to share ideas and pursue their passions.

Beyond the classroom, the wide range of organizations and events fosters a sense of belonging and provides endless opportunities for growth. Whether it’s engaging in lively discussions, collaborating on projects, or making lifelong friends, Vandy has been a place where I’ve felt empowered to explore my potential and prepare for the future.",

I took an advanced English class first semester. I got a B on the first paper and the professor called me to his office. He said - for a freshman that was amazing. You have potential. With a little work you could get an A and you should consider an English major. Then he looked at by books under the chair. He said \"Are you an Engineering Major?\" I said yes and he said - quote - \"Engineers don't get A's in English\". He dismissed me and never talked to me again. I got a B. - There goes the Founders Medal. I was president of two honor societies and got into Mortar Board.

The school really doesn’t do a great job preparing students for careers and is not anywhere close to being worth $90k a year. The only reason Vanderbilt students have good outcomes is because of the quality of students that get accepted. The majority of Vanderbilt students would have the same outcomes at any state school. The social scene is also not very good and the school makes it really hard for students to have fun. Save your money and go to state school or a better T15 school that might be able to help you get a job.",

            "Review": "As a Vanderbilt alum, I’ve seen firsthand how the social scene can be very cliquey and heavily centered around Greek life. If you don’t fit into a diversity group or if you like to party but don’t get into Greek life, it can feel like you’re kind of out of luck socially. Your freshman year really sets the tone for the rest of your time at Vandy, which is not ideal because a lot of people tend to stick to their comfort zones instead of branching out and meeting new people. If I could suggest a change, it would be to reform the Greek life system. I think it would be cool if anyone could join any Greek organization and get randomly assigned to a frat or sorority. After a year, if you’re not feeling it, you could enter a lottery to get placed in a new group and meet new people. It might help make things less about who you know and more about creating a broader, more inclusive social scene. Overall though, I would suggest Vanderbilt - I just think a lot of reform is needed.",

Being low-income, I also have the option to go to dining centers on campus.

There are always things going on, like free snow-cones on hot days or free slushies, etc. One day they even brought in dogs for us to pet when we walked to class. Even if it might seem boring sometimes, there’s always an event put up for students/parents to be entertained.",

Within my Masters of Public Health program, a smaller class size allows students to form better relationships and work closely. Additionally, there are many research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students looking to pursue a career in medical research. Another interesting thing about Nashville is that the university is located in Nashville; while this city offers many things to do, transportation was an issue. Overall, Vanderbilt already has an outstanding reputation as a university, however, it will only benefit students looking for a smaller class size or a generally smaller university.",

The campus is almost entirely segregated, with white Greek Life being central to white student life. Students wanted to be friends with other students just like them, rather than seeking out people diverse from them. There weren't many robust communities outside of Greek Life. Anyone who is not a white student in Greek Life probably doesn't love Vanderbilt--in fact, most POC students I knew hated it. All the positive reviews you're seeing, chances are, are from white greek life people for whom the school is built.",

Firstly, the freshman experience at Vanderbilt is wonderful in that all first year students live in one of ten dorms in the same vicinity on the same campus, referred to as \"Commons.\" This provides first year students with a great sense of community and camaraderie right off the bat. The school's location in Nashville also offers a wide breadth and depth of opportunities for students, ranging from exploring great food to becoming involved in impactful community outreach. Additionally, Vanderbilt is very much characterized by a collaborative spirit rather than a competitive one, as students enjoy studying together and helping one another find success. As a result of all these aspects of Vanderbilt, the students at this school tend to be extremely happy and fulfilled by their academic and social experiences here. I cannot say enough positive things about my time there.",

Likewise, they need to work on making the environment more inclusive and accepting for everyone. It's cliquey and hard to make friends if you aren't in an initial group.

Admittedly, I was excited to live off-campus for my last two years (but beware - living in Nashville is not cheap). Socially, I had a great time at Vandy, especially thanks to the liveliness of Nashville, but sadly not due to Vanderbilt sports - this is not their strong suit. I met lifelong friends at this school!

I am able to pursue both my academic and professional interests with support and opportunity. The residential requirement is frustrating as I'd like to be more independent and live in an apartment. The office of housing can be difficult to communicate with and are very unhelpful. The course selection is great and professors have added new ones based on student interests, such as sustainability and green development. There is a nice selection of student organizations and huge opportunity for leadership roles if you take the initiative. I am excited about the new immersion project requirement because this will look good on a resume. The career center and writing studio are great resources for students.",

I always struggled in education, but always ended up excelling for the most part because of a responsive academic community. For the first time in my educational career, however, Vanderbilt didn’t appreciate my concerns. All they did was send me to the UCC for testing, but never actually addressed my struggles on the academic side. I sent emails, letters etc., but no one on the academic side really cared to help me. It became clear to me once I graduated - Vanderbilt responds to academic struggle with the question of “what is wrong with you?” instead of “how can we help you?”. In other words, they got too excited about utilizing their UCC when I struggled academically and  didn’t want to meaningfully engage with those on the academic side (teachers, deans) about how to best support my unique learning needs.",

I miss the incredible opportunities to bond with strangers who became best friends, to try new activities and clubs that welcomed me like family and I miss Grin's Vegetarian Cafe, most of all.\n\nAt Vandy students went all out at everything we did, whether it was studying, being creative, pursuing our passions and certainly partying.

The campus was so alive. In terms of academics, class registration was probably the most stressful/frustrating thing. You think to yourself--I'm already accepted into this prestigious school, but it's all based on chance whether or not you can get the class you want to take because there's only a limited amount of seats in this class. Multiple times, it's a required class too. If only they provided more options that matched the demand of people wanting to take the class.",

Opportunities abound, students only have to reach out and take them. If you can get into this school, you'd be a fool not to attend. It truly is a home.",

Vanderbilt is also in Nashville, Tennessee, an amazing city that hosts more musical acts and events weekly than most places will in a year. There is never a shortage of fun in this fast-growing, active, and progressive city. The school is also apart of the SEC and has D1 baseball, basketball, and football making it one of very few private schools to have such a notable run of sports. All this considered, Vanderbilt is an incredibly open-minded school full of intellectuals that are driven by true collaboration and not harsh competition; an amazing place to study.",

There are a variety of resources on campus to help you feel supported and successful in your academic endeavors. They are currently working on rebuilding many dorms, and the new dorms are very nice. The campus food is much better than other schools and there are many different options.

Sophomore year, I started a mentorship program through our pre-med society for upperclassmen to mentor underclassmen, and I joined a research team investigating PTSD therapies at the Veteran’s Hospital. In my Junior year, I advocated for required relationship education for student groups and organized on-campus facilitators to educate our peers.

If you ever get bored, then there is normally some kind of show going on somewhere on campus. Alternatively, you could gather some friends to watch a movie in one of the seminar rooms.\n\n4.) Most of the people here are laid back and don't have a superiority complex. Impostor Syndrome is discussed every now and then though.\n\n5.)

At the same time, I can walk into a class and never have seen a majority of the students there but it definitely feels like a nice sized community. I hate those people, where I'm from, know nothing about the academic prestige of Vanderbilt and don't know where it is. The social life here is phenomenal and I couldn't imagine fitting in better anywhere else, I love seeing people from my classes who are at the top of the class but at the same time they were at a party the night before.",

The student body is segregated and has to often deal with racial, homophobic, etc. displays of hatred. The food options are getting worse and dining hall close at 8pm and are barely open on weekends. Meal plans decrease as you move up, so prepare to spend a lot of money on eating out and finding food elsewhere. Additionally, there are certain groups of people that are heavily protected on campus so sexual assaults by these people will receive a slap on the wrist.  Also there are some nice dorms and then there are dorms with mold. Despite the slogan, students here are by far NOT the happiest students in the nation.",

The school is now making all students live on campus however their dorm that is housing 600+ students is not ready for the new year. Absolutely terrible. They also don’t let anyone live off campus, so if you were hoping to have fun in college, don’t apply here. On top of that, the academics and D1 sports really are average. Half the professors can’t speak English or are too focused on their own research / lives to teach a class well. After having been here for over 2 years, I wish I had known how bad this school was before I applied and would transfer if it wasn’t already too late.",

There is a high fitness culture on campus that can make it seem like a sin to engage in greasy chicken wings from the pub, but nobody will judge you to your face. The campus is large and pretty, but be prepared to walk. I repeat, NOT CAR FRIENDLY!",

I have found life long friends at Vanderbilt and also very much enjoyed the social scene of Nashville and the Vanderbilt campus itself. I learned more over the past four years than I have in my entire life.  The classes and professors at Vanderbilt made me excited to learn and more interested in subjects I once found mundane.",

There are many intellectuals in the faculty, but you have to find them in the right class. Some are just focused on trying to be landlords or working with big biotech companies. The undergrads are not very future-driven and their party atmosphere revolves around frats and getting slammed drunk. I have even seen my peers who are advanced MDPhD students, get incoherently drunk, and hope they will stop when they see patients. Postdocs, too. Basically, there is a huge drinking culture, little diversity compared to Stanford, but  Nashville is enjoyable.",

Most White people are a part of Panhellenic or IFC councils, but there are also NPHC (historically Black) sororities and fraternities very active on campus.  Currently, we have every chapter except the Alpha Phi Alpha, Sigma Gamma Rho, and Iota Phi Theta.  The NPHC Greek life pretty much coincides with the Black community on campus, as Panhellenic and IFC Greek life coincides with the majority of the White population.  The Panhellenic and IFC are so prevalent though so members of all races know about the parties and events.  Sometimes the members can be kind of exclusive though.  The Panhellenic and IFC sororities and frats don't really interact or for the most part aren't even aware of the NPHC sororities and frats, which I think is a main contributor to the segregated atmosphere of campus.",

Sororities also cannot hold parties, and any pregames have to be held off campus or in the dorms of some srat girls. You're guaranteed a bid if you make it to pref night, which is awesome. Formal rush happens over two weekends coming back from winter break, and it's pretty regulated, unlike fraternity rush.\r\n\r\nFraternities are big.

In terms of blacks and hispanics, I'd say we have more than most schools. With that said, there is room for improvement. Vandy knows that, and each class is becoming more and more diverse. Campus is probably close to half and half in terms of political beliefs, we have people representing all sorts of SES (great financial aid), but overall students are rich. Probably fewer LGBT individuals because of stigmas of the south, but a strong majority are open to anyone. Geographic diversity is amazing. We have people from everywhere, and we have been getting more from the West Coast recently, which is the only area that probably used to be underrepresented. Great diversity now, and with the direction of the school, I think we will be one of the most diverse campuses in the country in a few years. Nobody should be afraid of Vandy because they are a racial or ethnic diversity; just because we are in the south does not change the fact that we are a diverse, open environment.",

            "Review": "Greek life is a stain on Vanderbilt's reputation. I can say that as a white male that grew up in a rich suburb in California, I was looked down upon for not being a part of a fraternity. The divide between greeks and non-greeks is generally racial and socioeconomic: greeks tend to be rich and white from suburbia and do not receive financial aid. They snottily look down upon non-greeks as second-class students. Greek life divides the campus in a very palpable and regrettable way.\r\n\r\nBut the real problem is that the culture greek life creates is preventing Vanderbilt from truly being considered an Ivy League-level school. Incidents like SAE destroying its house, DKE getting busted for cocaine dealing, and alumni coming to campus for a football game and having to walk through beer cans strewn everywhere dent the school's reputation. Until it rids itself of greek life altogether, it will have trouble making it to the level of the top 12.",

The only complaint I have regarding visitation is that the hours should be extended. If residence hall lockdowns are to begin at 8 pm, let it be during the weekends rather than on Thursdays. Also, allow students with a Vanderbilt ID to enter all the residence halls, regardless of whether they live there or not. It's not fair for me to be denied access to Towers 1/2 when my residence hall does not have any laundry facilities, nor is it fair to be denied access to Towers 3/4 when the munchie mart, a public student facility, is in there.",

At first glance, the average student on campus looks very attractive. Delicious even. As soon as partying weekends hit or classes start, you will no longer think them attractive and you are left wondering how in the hell they managed to get accepted by Vanderbilt. The average student is preppy, only interested in makeup and boys, lazy, disgusting pigs, sleep around like nobody's business, always out partying, rude, stuck-up and prissy, and most likely a psych major. \r\n\r\nNow, the non average student, which they are kind of hard to find on occasion, are cool, classy and chic. Easy going, interested in chilling and just talking, not huge on the 'get drunk until we pass out' scene.

Burglaries and muggings are frequent on and near the campus, and we don't receive conflict resolution emails so I believe there haven't been any conflict resolutions. \r\n\r\nIf students live anywhere near the freshman dorms or frats and sororities, they should find a friend who lives far from there to stay with on the weekends. The noise is INCREDIBLE. Students just don't care because the adults don't care. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are many underage students who end up in the hospital regularly with alcohol poisoning, but the school keeps letting them off the hook, and the pattern continues.",

There is barely any fan support. Students will pre-game and attend the beginning of the big games and party when we win, but they rarely show up to most of the games. School spirit is high, but actual fan support is incredibly low. \r\n\r\nTraining facilities are great and open to the general public.

The smaller school size (as compared to a state school) allows you to know (or at least be aware of) basically everyone who's involved in the Greek community. Despite having a smaller student population than big state schools, there are a comparable number of Greek House; this allows for a greater chunk of the students to get involved.\r\n\r\nFor guys, the entire first semester is dedicated to rush, which makes the first year is an incredible experience. This lengthy rush season and general lack of regard for \"legacy status\" (it does matter at a few houses) allows the students to be sorted into the Fraternities in which they would fit in best.\r\n\r\nFor girls, the first semester can be nerve-wracking with limited permissible communication to and from Sorority members. The rush is hectic but has a very regular 2 week time-frame.\r\n\r\nThe University does not allow Greek housing for more than 6 people per house.

It's a little harder for guys to find their place and a lot more determinate of their social lives, but as far as girls are concerned that are planning to go through recruitment, they will for sure find a place and girls that they love unless they do something really stupid to mess it up. fraternity parties are pretty much the gut of the social scene at vandy but for girls, even if you aren't greek you can totally take part. greeks throw events all the time and are really involved in community service. i'm not non-greek so i don't really know what they think about us but i think everyone realizes that everyone has a place where they fit in and everyone can make that decision on their own without being judged. only 6 people live in each house and they're all officers which is cool because even if your friends aren't in the same organization as you, you can still live together and see them all the time.",

The MOSAIC program is unrivaled in my opinion. Vanderbilt is actively trying to increase diversity. I know we have a reputation of being white/preppy/southern but I think that's about to change in the next few years. I will say however that there is a disproportionate amount of affluent students. I feel that many of the students seem disconnected from real world problems because they are primarily upper-middle class or rich. Religious diversity needs some work too. May have just been coincidence but most of the people I met last year were Catholic or Jewish. Then again, most top tier universities have this problem.",

There is a lot of ethnic/racial diversity. Many people are on scholarships and financial aid leading to a more socioeconomic diversity. The school is pretty balanced between Republicans and Democrats. There is definitely religious diversity and acceptance. There is some diversity of sexual orientation and Vanderbilt definitely tries to promote acceptance of diverse sexual orientations. Overall, Vanderbilt has done a good job with their diversity, but there is still more they can work towards to improving it, which I believe they are doing.",

Most of the black students are here on athletic scholarships. Sad to have to list these stereotypes, but they are true for the most part. There is a severe lack of diversity in interests here.

Vanderbilt made headlines for determining to uniformly enforce the non-discrimination policy for school-sponsored organizations (the case came up in regards to a gay student's right to leadership within an organization), which inadvertently led to the claim that the non-discrimination policy was discriminatory against conservative and religious groups.  There are still some hard feelings and debates, with the usual polemics and straw man arguments.\r\n\r\nThe inability of some dominate groups to not just begrudgingly cooperate with others is probably the main obstacle to inclusive and further diversity on campus.",

Judging by average reviews on ratemyprofessor and other sites, though, Vandy is much less of a victim of this. Our teachers are overall better than pretty much every other school, and Vandy does truly have an undergrad focus. In my experience, my teachers have almost exclusively been great. The workload is difficult, and while it is relatively easy to have a GPA in the 3.3 range (except in a few engineering majors), it is difficult to get a very high GPA. The students at Vandy are as smart as anywhere. Vandy cares about demonstrated intelligence more than other top schools in admissions I'd say (other schools care a ton about uniqueness), and so students are pretty consistently smart across the board. Top students, top professors, lots of courses of study, truly cannot find better academics for general arts and sciences/HOD.",

They want you to succeed and get as high a grade as possible (especially in Peabody).\r\n\r\nSciences, however, are hit or miss. Introductory weed-out class professors are ruthless and leave you to fend for yourselves against the hard material and even harder exams. This isn't bad per se, but you can definitely feel these classes packing heat and stress. I'm sure there are wonderful professors in the STEM departments, but I have yet to find one. The ones I've had experience with are very hard, unreasonable, apathetic, bad at teaching, or any combination of the four. It's not uncommon to study for more than 30 hours per week on a subject and still end up with a C or B- on an exam. At least my humanities professors were able to empathize with me and give me leniency. Perhaps that's why many science majors look down upon Peabody and humanities students who claim to have a hard time: it's the leniency and leeway they have compared to science majors.\r\n\r\nBut all this difficulty prepares you to buckle down and have better study habits for next time.

            "Review": "I am in a Pre-medical program and track filled with general sciences like physics, chemistry, and biology and maths like calculus. Some examples of extra courses to take are psychology, sociology, neuroscience, and statistics. I find that the program I am in is too constricting, though I do enjoy it. These courses, though understandable that they would take much of my time, fill out my entire schedule and leave me with no room to pursue other interests in school like ceramics or new languages. Because schedules set a cap at 18 hours for all courses taken, and the sciences require labs, discussions classes, courses, and recitations (and sciences are often doubled up), most of the schedule is taken up with little room for other interesting courses. Because pre-med is not a major, we have difficulty finding a major that won't take up what little room we have left in our schedules, and many of us are limited to science majors.\r\n\r\nThe actual courses themselves are either hit or miss. Some of the teachers are absolutely excellent, but like all schools, getting into those courses is competitive and all slots are generally filled right from the start, especially if you're in a second enrollment window and make your choices last. So most of the time, you are left with either a teacher who is brutally uncaring of students' outside lives and don't have any qualms squashing them with difficult tests, extreme amounts of homework, projects, and quizzes with no curves. Or you are left with a professor who is highly intelligent, but is terrible at conveying the information to the students, leaving them frustrated and confused for the better part of the course.",

Engineering, by far is the most difficult to get a good GPA, I believe a 2.8 is slightly higher than the average engineer. Some majors are able to pass by through with good GPA's, but you still have to be truly brilliant. There's very few dumb people here. Everyone came here with 4.0's and 30 ACTs, so expect getting a few B's and even some C's.",

Several libraries with many places to study that are open 24/7 (which is great during exam week), decent athletic center, great events for socializing, and fun free activities and club performances. The campus is great. Vanderbilt has wonderful facilities and campus life is rewarding and refreshing.",

However, we have free campus shuttles, called Vandy Vans, that run from 5pm-5am every day and stop at multiple areas of campus. Taxis are ridiculously abundant, and they come right up to the dorms and wait for students on weekend nights, and they are the transportation of choice when going downtown. They take our Commodore Cards (school ID cards) so they are convenient since you don't need cash. Many upperclassmen have cars, but most underclassmen do not, as it is not needed. Nashville public buses run frequently, are free to students, and have stops around campus, but are not utilized by many students because they aren't needed.

Its nice; the guys appreciate underdressed girls, the girls love warm weather fashion and shades. The campus is GORGEOUS. But, frequent rain makes rainboots a necessity, and there is the bad thunderstorms, campus flooding, and tornado watches. Students never get out of class, so we have to deal with both extreme heat and bad rain. In winter, it actually gets pretty cold. Peacoats/trenchcoats necessary. A little snow, and the roads get bad easily in winter because clean up services for snow are limited. Overall, warm weather and a beautiful campus is worth it.",

Other students in STEM majors seem to be \"dropped on their behinds.\"   Often times engineering majors GPA's are too low to even score any internships during their undergraduate careers and find it hard to get in grad school or find jobs in their field afterwards- which is ridiculous.  For the class of 2016, the mean salary for chemical engineers was only $68,000.  Chemical engineering is supposed to have one of the top three undergraduate entering salaries.  For Vanderbilt to be a top fifteen school, that is not a lot at all.  It's mostly because the grading scale at Vandy tends to be lower than other schools.  No one is handing out any A's: a B is the new A, a C is the new B and a D is the new C.  An A in a STEM class is very few and far between.  The problem is that Vandy is not acclaimed as a STEM school, so when you go to career fairs and apply for internships, you're often overlooked because of a low GPA, when truly, a 3.0 at Vandy is basically equivalent to at least a 3.6 at the majority of the schools of the students you're competing with. Vandy is not like an MIT, Rice or Stanford though so recruiters do not recognize this.  I'm a hardworking student, go to office hours tutoring and all that good stuff, but I do feel that engineering majors are screwed over at Vandy.",

            "Review": "The Arts and Sciences career center is a joke. I only had one friend who used the career services on a regular basis, and he was not able to land a single internship using them. He ended up getting an internship with a bulge bracket investment bank through a family connection.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, if you do not seek out their help, they will not be of any assistance to you. And the school does not host a lot of top companies. The only industries that it is decent at are health care and consulting. Health care is a major industry in Nashville because of the tax incentives offered by the state of Tennessee to health care companies. Consulting is decent because a number of Vanderbilt alumni have gone on to work for major consulting firms. But in reality, none of the classes at Vanderbilt are really that useful for going into consulting. Thus, you're going to have to sell yourself to the consulting firms as a well-rounded generalist.",

Vandy also offers competitive merit scholarships and an automatic 5k for national merit placement.

The problem is most colleges who offer such generous financial aid packages are also very, very hard to get into. Every Ivy League college, Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, Rice, and Washington University are examples. All of the above colleges have one thing in common: A boatload of money. Vanderbilt's endowment for 2012 is $3.4 billion.\r\n\r\nThe statistics on Vanderbilt's financial aid website are somewhat false. I estimate a good half of the students at Vanderbilt receive $1000 or less in financial aid to pay for their $60,000 cost of attendance because their parents are already making hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions. But guess where the rest of the financial aid budget goes... yes, to the needy!\r\n\r\nSeveral students I know pay $0 to attend Vanderbilt. They get a small stipend every year to cover their living expenses because their families make so little income. The downside is everything at Vanderbilt costs money. Laundry, water, utensils... anything you got for free before will now be deducted from your Commodore Cash or Meal Money accounts.",

There is also flexible Meal Money with all meal plans that can be used anywhere on campus or at about 20 restaurants off campus. \r\nAfter freshman year the compulsory meal plan gets smaller - 14/week for sophomores, 8/week for juniors, none for seniors. You can opt for larger meal plans or buy extra Flex meals (they're usually cheaper in bulk). \r\nVanderbilt Dining puts in great effort to get feedback from students, such as updating the Meal Money restaurant selection, or hosting mega themed buffet dining events each semester. Those are awesome treats where the dining hall is all decked out and makes up for the sometimes monotonous offering regularly.",

On top of that, Hillsboro Village has tons of cute little restaurants, like Pancake Pantry, Fido and Provence Cafe that are always worth a visit.

Nashville has a young atmosphere and that is well reflected in the variety of restaurants surrounding the Vanderbilt area. Hillsbourgh village offers smaller, more college-friendly options (by cost and attire) such as bars, quick-dinning sushi at Zumi, and all-america style places like Jacksons, Cabana, and Sunset Grill. While no places that I know of offer consistent student discounts, several of the places in this Hillsbourgh area take the \"vanderbilt card\"-- students love this. The Downtown area known as the Gulch offers relatively more fine-dinning options. Along west-end, there are several family-style restaurants like Amerigo's and Bricktops, or a large-group favorite like Goten habachi. Historical favorites are also spotted throughout Nashville, such as the speak-easy Patternson House, which despite its high drinks prices, has the absolute best drinks and bartenders in town. Vegetarians, adventure-hunters, and rich Vandy alumni's will all enjoy a little taste of Nashville.",

The best places in my opinion are the Commons Dining Hall, which has several different choices from a salad bar to Chinese food, and Chef James, which has a different hot entree each day. Although healthy eating isn't the easiest, with a little bit of effort and planning, it's definitely possible. I recommend trying to live off campus, that way you can avoid the meal plan altogether and eat what you want!",

There's a good chance you'll get a little tired of attempts at biscuits and gravy. The best options as far as variety and taste are the Commons (where all freshmen live), Grins (the only certified Kosher restaurant in middle Tennessee. It's also vegetarian and has fantastic pastries.), and Nectar (the only completely organic place on-campus).\r\nThe great thing about the way Vandy's meal plan is set up is that they offer something called Taste of Nashville, which gives students the option to use their meal money at off-campus restaurants, such as Chili's, Qdoba, TGIFriday's, and many more.",

The \"upperclass\" dining area called Rand is a bit more traditional and the food choices are mediocre but still good. I know there will be more additions in the future.

There are not many healthy dining options with fresh food on campus.  For example, one of the few on campus restaurants is a barbecue place which is definitely not good for you and is not good for eating at frequently. The only brandname dining is Quiznos which isn't great.  Vanderbilt forces you to have large meal plans which is expensive so it is very disappointing that it isn't good.

I love this rule because I think it creates a strong sense of community.  The freshman dorms are amazing! All the freshman stay on the same part of campus called \"The Commons.\"  It consists of ten houses which are the dorms and the Commons Center, which holds the dining hall, a minimart, the gym, and study rooms.  An esteemed faculty member is chosen for each of the houses, and they stay in the houses with the students and serve as \"The Head of House.\"  I really enjoyed living on Commons because I think it truly helps with the freshman adjustment.  You get to live separately from the rest of campus with everyone in your class, and it's comforting to be with everyone else who's is brand new, unfamiliar and going through a lot of the same things as you are.  It also helps to foster strong friendships because everyone is located so close.",

The housing at Vanderbilt is amazing which is why most students choose to live on campus for all four years.

Nobody likes to venture out of their rooms to meet or hang out with others who live in the same building. McGill is the exception to this, but in terms of building quality and cleanliness, every single residence hall needs to be renovated. There's mold and a musty smell in at least one corner of each building. I have yet to find a building other than Kissam or Commons where students do not need dehumidifiers. In my res hall, there's no thermostat, so you're stuck between frigid AC when the temp is >55 degrees and sweltering heaters when <55 degrees, both on full blast. \r\n\r\nThe dorms also need more and better social spaces. Almost every floor in every hall is nothing but corridors, which leaves no space for socializing or studying with others on the same floor. Recreation rooms in the residence hall have very few amenities (e.g. Tolman has only a foosball table in its basement). Study spaces are almost non-existent.\r\n\r\nThe only downside to Commons is its distance from main campus. As for upperclass housing, Morgan/Lewis seem to be the best in terms of cleanliness and space. The major downside to the \"nice\" housing, however, is the distance from everything except the gym and Blair. Basically, you pick between quality and convenience.",

And the other dorms vary. The newer or more recently renovated, the greater the amenities, spaciousness, perks and quality of the dorm. The older the dorm, the worse the rooms and facilities. The upperclassman housing are basically around the perimeter of the academic buildings and halls, so getting to the dorms isn't hard. There are limited options for housing for sophomores with most being either smack dab in the middle of the horrible frat row or in shabby, old dorms. As an upperclassman, your best option will be Morgan and Lewis (the downside being nearby the stadium, bad parking and horrible traffic on game weeks which is frequent). Your worst is Vandy Barnard (or \"Barnyard\" if you will). \r\n\r\nCost, social atmosphere, and ballots are the same no mater where you apply, so those don't really matter.\r\n\r\nAmenities include laundry, kitchens (not fully stocked), lounges, music rooms for some dorms, etc. The best dorms have full amenities; the worst are only missing ones that aren't as necessary, but they still have the basics.",

Some are smaller but the Commons program makes it feel very warm and welcoming. Each Commons dorm (there are 10) has its own faculty head whose family lives in the building - feels like Hogwarts! \r\nUpperclassmen get to ballot for housing - there are seniority points. Huge range of options from location to atmosphere to housing type - 2, 4, 6 person apartments, or singles/double rooms. Most buildings are co-ed with single-sex floors, but there are co-ed apartments and single-sex buildings too. There are also special learning environments you have to apply for which involve some participation over the school year (Mctyiere for foreign languages, Mcgill for independent projects, Vandy-Barnard for Leadership or Creativity, and Mayfield 10-person houses with special projects). \r\nSince the cost is the same for all these places, it really allows you to pick somewhere to live based on your preference and not cost.",

For the short version, go to Towers for partying, or Vanderbilt and Barnard for studying.\r\n\r\nThe most social dorm is Carmichael Towers West, where people live in large suites and party hard on the weekends. Towers East is also very social, but has more single rooms and a few doubles. The Branscomb Quadrangle is yet another party dormitory due to being in close proximity to Fraternity Row, and thus houses many brothers and sisters. Vanderbilt and Barnard halls are connected and have spacious single and double rooms, with a less raging party scene than any of the above. Highland Quad has very large suites (4 or more people) and is located far away from everything, but is very quiet. Blakemore House is the newest dormitory on campus but is also far away from everything; I would assume things are quiet there as well, and very nice. Cole and Tolman are the women and men only dorms, but I know very little about them. McTyeire residents are required to speak in a foreign language (they are either international or anti-social) and are forced eat dinner there on a regular basis, but everything there is new and clean due to being renovated 20 years ago. Greek Row has nice houses in plain sight of everybody who walks on campus. Last, Kissam Quadrangle is being rebuilt, and sure to be amazing in two or three years.",
