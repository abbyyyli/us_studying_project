The exposure to different teams and the mentorship I received helped me grow both personally and professionally. I also appreciated the inclusive culture that promoted open communication and collaboration. Being part of such a dynamic and supportive environment allowed me to develop new skills and broaden my perspective.\n\nWhat I'd Like to See Change: While I had an overall positive experience, I would have loved to see more structured feedback throughout the internship or program. Having regular check-ins or constructive feedback would help guide my development and ensure I'm on the right track. Additionally, more networking opportunities with senior leaders or people outside of my immediate team would be beneficial for a well-rounded experience.",

            "Review": "Washington University in St. Louis is an incredible place to learn and grow. Academics are tough, but professors genuinely care and are accessible. Collaboration is encouraged, making even the hardest classes manageable. The campus is beautiful, and Forest Park next door is a huge plus. Social life depends on how much you put yourself out there—there are tons of clubs, student events, and a mix of Greek life and non-Greek activities. Dorms are nice, and while the food is decent, it could be better. The workload is intense, but support is available through tutoring, office hours, and wellness programs. The WashU bubble is real, but St. Louis has great places to explore if you make the effort. The student body is diverse but leans wealthy, which can sometimes be noticeable. Overall, WashU is a rigorous but rewarding place, and if you find balance between academics and social life, it can be an amazing experience.",

I have come to love the people and the community that makes up my school because of its rich diversity and welcome representation from various countries all over the world. My school also boasts of the best housing accommodations, as well as one of the top food and dining facilities across the country. Not to mention the world-class recreational amenities and libraries that are open and accessible to students even during the wee hours of the morning which has helped me tremendously during finals season. Known for its academically-rigorous curriculum, WashU has allowed me realize my intellectual potential, and push me to be better. Although my school has a good mental health program in place, having a more active and relatable initiative would probably benefit the students given its highly competitive and motivated environment.",

The food quality is generally good as college food goes, but it varies.\nThe real issues are:\n\n- The dining hall hours are restricted\n- You don't get to serve yourself: \n              - no power over your portion size\n             - don't get to pick and choose from different food stations without paying extra\n- The meal points system make food (especially healthy) VERY expensive\n- I could only transfer points once from a friend at a discount\n\nThey have started a buffet  pilot program in BD, which is better, but this is only one dining hall M-F for dinner (this is also worse quality). \n\nI had the platinum plan this fall and had to get thousands more meal points after I ran out in mid- October, even though I tried to eat the cheapest and healthiest food I can find. \n\nNo one seems to want to take responsibility for this problem. I received 250 extra points via the food security fund.",

            "Review": "Overall great school, but in 2024 the food deserves a D or an F. The school requires freshmen live on campus and buy a pretty expensive meal plan, so there is no excuse for it not being its worth. The meal plan is not 1:1 USD to meal points (so each meal point costs about $1.10) and yet the food is absurdly expensive AND low quality. Low quality food is annoying, but understandable if it is cheap. Expensive food is annoying, but understandable if it is high-quality. The main cafeteria's cheeseburger costs 12 meal points (~15usd) and is significantly lower quality than the sub-$7 McDonalds quarter pounder. \n\nWashU will not fix this situation until its rankings suffer because of it. Other than this one issue, WashU is an outstanding school, but in this category, it completely fails.",

My only concern is the price, especially coming from a middle class family. My mom makes 85K a year, and my dad 70K, however, they are divorced, with two separate houses and lives. Neither one supports me. But because they make that much money, my tuition charge is 20% of their combined income in a year.

I found the student life, athletics, extracurriculars, etc..., basically everything EXCEPT academics, to be lacking.  There's more to a great university than pretty buildings and chasing rankings, and those things are obvious priorities at WashU.  If rankings, pretty buildings, and a purely academic experience speak to you, you may really like it here.  I found it somewhat isolating.  St. Louis is a struggling city, but the area around WashU is actually pretty nice.  There are good off-campus activities and diversions.",

CS department could be stronger; premed/ bio/chem/pre-law deps / olin are excellent. \nThe undergraduate student body is tight-knit and mostly extremely friendly. People are very smart but not obnoxious or entitled. Campus life is great because many of the undergrads (freshmen, sophomores, and some juniors) live on campus. The housing is excellent, and many students have kitchens on campus. St Louis is certainly not a luxury city (i.e. NY or LA) but does have good restaurants (DRIVE NOT WALK AWAY) and a cheap cost of living (concerts are usually way cheaper).

I saw the good and the bad of WashU and stayed through both. There was a learning curve to this education journey, but throughout the path I met lifelong friends, forged deep and meaningful connections, and better understand the future that lies ahead.",

All of my classes are enjoyable and teachers make an effort to be accessible and understanding with students. WashU has so many resources, such as the career center, writing center, tutoring centers like the math help room et cetera, so you always know where to get help when feeling overwhelmed. Even though we don't have much sports culture, there is still a student body culture and school pride-- this is shown through things like our convocation, where all of the incoming freshman dress up in the colors of their residential college and celebrate starting the school year. WashU also promotes collaboration, such as study groups and extracurriculars, much more than most schools making it easy to find friends. In general, most people I know are happy at WashU, and I'm super glad I decided to come here.",

But there's not a ton of variety in the main dining halls, and restaurants close pretty early. Most of the food locations aren't open on weekends either.) People on campus have always been helpful and inviting. Classmates are supportive in terms of forming study groups and sharing notes if you need help. There are resources for students (similar to many other universities) like a writing center, academic advising, and peer mentoring. They advertise a ton of different student groups to get involved in, and there really is something for everyone, and the people are really inviting. But some of the groups can be really competitive!",

While the programs may be hard, there are resources and tutors out there to take advantage of. WashU has a lot of academic support, but the biggest thing they are lacking in is mental health support. I have struggled more with mental health due to the stress of being here, and I know a lot of friends have struggled too.

I disliked the food at WashU, especially the way that food options were incredibly limited on the main campus after a certain hour, literally after only 3 or 5 pm (which is SO early). It was incredibly inconvenient how the main dining hall's food options were closed on the weekends as well, it posed a barrier to any student who found themselves studying on campus during the weekend as there was a lack of food options. Some of my professors were not the best to say the least. I feel like WashU should definitely look at the people the hire better, especially the ones who teach the larger lecture courses.

However, the administration is definitely controlled by those who lean right politically. They power washed away Trans Lives Matter and BLM protests, they had campus police follow a peaceful protest around fossil fuels, they did not protect a student who shared their political beliefs, and they allowed a transphobic, homophobic speaker on campus for the Republican club on campus.",

I feel like the transition to college has been made much easier in this environment and really enjoy being a part of the WashU community.

You will spend a huge amount of your time studying, and a decent amount crying because of how hard the work is. If you read that and still want to go, this is the right school for you. WashU is one of the best schools in the country for pre-med and other graduate education. Equally important: the people are genuinely friendly, the professors will make time for you, and the quality-of life standards are higher than almost any other college offers.",

I enjoy the freedom of my class schedule, especially in comparison to friends at other schools who have a far-higher mandated schedule for their Freshman year. I also love the Ampersand programs. My Ampersand, Global Citizenship Program, has been my favorite class throughout the year and I will be devastated when it's over next year! My class is traveling to Ecuador in the spring and I could not be more excited. The dedication to these programs is incredible and I am extremely grateful for it. I think the dorms are better than average and the beds are very comfortable - the South 40 is a really great place to live. Overall, I would highly recommend WashU to any prospective student looking for an enriching academic environment with a high quality of living.",

The college has great connections for post-grad opportunities in multiple fields - business, medicine, research, engineering. I was easily able to switch between the Arts & Sciences program and the Business School at the end of my sophomore year. There is a huge focus on medicine, so even for other career paths there are healthcare adjacent offerings (e.g. Healthcare Management, Bio Medical Engineering, Global Health, Psychology/Neuroscience/Philosophy). The brand name and resources do carry for other non-health related professions too. The classwork can be tough so it's best you find out which paths are a good fit for you in terms of academic rigor, class size, and teaching style. Your counselors can help with this. \n\nGood size of the school - not too big to get lost, but not too small to know everyone and the campus is very very beautiful! I suggest visiting and talking to alum to learn more!",

It lacks in providing adequate financial support, addressing issues of mental health through paying peer counselors and providing enough services, and addressing oppressive structures that it benefits from, such as Greek Life and investing in Fossil Fuels.\nAlthough there are distribution requirements, non-humanities students can graduate without taking any course related to social/political issues that plague our society, so it can also feel very isolating when surrounded by students who are just grinding to get into med school or consulting. Similarly, as a gentrifying entity, Wash U must do a better job of getting students into the St. Louis community. Most Wash U students only enter the city to go to Wash U-funded clubs, there isn't good enough transportation to consistently volunteer somewhere, and St. Louis events are not promoted enough.",

That being said, students still have the freedom to push themselves as hard as they feel prepared to; one can choose to get by with 12 units or 21. As a pre-med, WashU's resources also helped me prepare a very competitive profile when I applied to MD-PhD programs owing to the research, shadowing, and volunteering opportunities both on the Danforth Campus and WUSM.\n\nStudent life is not super high-energy, but still active. Most students I acquainted myself with were approachable and highly talented.\n\nThe area around WashU and the medical school is affluent and there were few safety concerns when I attended. Forest Park and the Sumers Rec Center provide both indoor and outdoor spaces for people to stay active. Dining is relatively high quality and the school housing options are comfortable to live in.\n\nOverall, I'd spend my college years here again without hesitation!",

Most students who attend are pre-med, but there's a wide range of diversity in majors. The school offers multiple resources for all majors to seek help. It's a very collaborative community, and students are comfortable going to office hours and study sessions to ask questions or seek clarification on subjects. \n\nMy only complaint would be the \"WashU Bubble\" a lot of students fall into, where they tend to stay invested with things on campus and don't go out and support the local St. Louis community.

There are a few classes--usually the very large STEM classes--where the structure can be very rigid. But in general, professors put a lot of work into their classes, and are very invested in your learning. The smaller the class, the better the professor (usually). The campus is beautiful, and it's fairly easy to get around. It's probably a 15-20min walk from one end of main-campus to the other. The dorms and housing are pretty good, especially in comparison to some other schools, but it really depends where you end up. Biggest downsides? The workload is hard. The lack of economic and ethnic diversity is very apparent. Financial aid office is usually incompetent. The party scene exists, but its.. um.. I personally have more fun at the club. Last but NOT LEAST: The food has gone DOWNHILL. It's just generally not great tasting. My friend once bit right into a raw chicken tender. Like.. raw raw.",

At the end of the day, I believe what WashU provides its students is unparalleled, and something I will treasure for the rest of my life.

Classes are poorly designed and do not provide skill sets that were up to the current trend in the professional world. Job resources are limited, especially for international students, and the already limited resources are deliberately gave to only MBA students by school's career center. I actually saw from a career a advisor's computer that an employer was looking for both MBA and SMP students for the two openings, but the advisor ended up only posting the jobs on MBA exclusive job board. \n\nEspecially not recommended to international students, because school staffs lack basic knowledge of students' eligibility and limitations granted under F-1 visa. Someone from my class almost got kicked out of country because school forgot to apply CPT for her during her internship.",

First of all she got a full ride, they removed a massive strain off of our family and did it completely and thoroughly. She had met and spoken with several faculty members before applying (Early Decision) and visited the campus, and they were so helpful and supportive it really allowed us to make a confident Early Decision. My daughter is gifted, but shy shy shy, and her mother is Brazilian, so VERY attached and we worried about sending her away. It was tough, but the support of programs like Deneb Stars and the many other programs (including late night escorts for safety) allowed her to make the leap and find her feet. Once the pandemic hit, WashU was amongst the first half dozen schools to move online (they are now hybrid, my daughter is working from home). The faculty and admin prioritized their health first, while the coursework has remained rigorous. She is thriving. A+ response Washu!",

When I went on a tour of the school my tour guide did a great job of reeling me in. I loved everything about the school. One thing that really stood out to me was the tutoring program they had available for all students. I think this a great thing to have.",

Freshmen have the choice of a modern or traditional dorm (one with or without a personal bathroom) which is a very nice option. The food is also amazing as we are ranked at the top of many best college food lists. I especially love the tator tots!",

The students are great, they come from all over the world, they are academically very strong, but the class environment is collaborative and not cut throat. You do not need to work hard though - you will be pushed by some of the classes. Grading is not easy, some classes do curve the grades. However, there are many support services and as mentioned the class environment is generally collaborative and students are very open.  Finally the dorm life for frosh and sophomore on campus is excellent. For upperclassmen there is plenty of university owned housing available right next to campus. The university is very safe it is in a great part of St Louis. You can/should go into the city - it is very interesting and there are ways to get involved if you are so inclined.",

The atmosphere's always positive, students and faculty alike are always super willing to help and support, and the professors are all sociable, capable in their fields, and clear in lecture and on paper. Clubs here, as abundant and as diverse as they are, find ways to, when possible, work together to at times set up and hold mutiple cross-cultural and cross-disciplined events on campus. Research opportunities, as well as employment for undergraduates both on and off campus, are offered generously and, almost always, will be provided and made available to those who seek to get involved. The food here is great as well; menus both on and off campus are diverse and palatable enough to keep the appetite up and busy year round.",

The business school allows for a lot of flexibility in humanities electives while providing a solid business foundation.  The business school is a very collaborative environment which is unlike the cut-throat culture in other elite universities. \nHowever, there are some downsides to WashU.  There is no party scene at WashU anymore.  The university continues to crack down on all social fraternities and sororities, and the administration has a goal of fully eliminating greek life.  The campus food is trash. I have no idea how WashU is highly ranked for campus food.  Also, there is an extreme lack of diversity at WashU.  WashU is ranked #2 in the nation for the least diverse universities in terms of socio-economic status. The quality of life for students is pretty low because the administration hates fun.",

I've taken courses in tort law, contracts, intellectual property law, legal negotiations, legal writing & legal procedures & court hearings. The Masters program is 100% online. The virtual experience is phenomenal. It's like being in an actual class, but at home. This program is very diverse. Through this program, I've connected with different students from Asia, Europe, Africa and the various parts of the United States. The professors are knowledgeable and professionally accomplished in the legal field. The program is fast paced, intriguing  and fun. You can complete this program in one to two years.  I started in January 2019 and I'm graduating in May 2020. CHOOSE WASHU! The investment is well worth it and WashU is one of the best law schools in the world.",

As a member of greek life on campus I can say the school is making it harder to have and go to parties than it was as a non greek-life freshman student.  I'm not sure why WashU has an A- rating on Niche for party scene, I honestly cannot think of a school with a worse party scene.

Most people in Greek Life are also highly involved in other areas of campus, so it can be hard to dissociate a positive Greek influence compared to individual contributions. While Greek life is not as big as it may be at state schools, it does have a large influence on campus, especially in the social scene. You can easily have a good time not being Greek here, but you may feel left out at certain times, especially if many of your friends choose Greek life. Only fraternities have houses, though two houses exist for a mixture of Greek women, simply a residential space to encourage a friendly inter-sorority experience.",

            "Review": "Wash U is a good school (challenging work, academically inclined peers, opportunities, decent food, nice big dorms that don't resemble jail cells) but the party scene isn't very accepting (frats/clubs/sports). Its okay though because the frats on campus aren't necessarily at the top of everyone's list (appealing, if you will). If you're into beer pong, subtle culture appropriation, rhythmless dancing, drunken PDA and mixers, then on campus partying is your thing. If you're anything like me (black and from Chicago), then you'll want to go off campus to concerts and/or neighboring schools for parties (Harris Stowe State University (HBCU), Saint Louis University, UMSL or SIUE). The downside to this is transportation. You'll have to take the Metrobus, Metrolink, uber or taxi unless you have upperclassman friends with cars. Also, parties are usually $5-10 that are hosted by Alphas/Kappas and they usually up-charge if its crowded. Concerts and clubs are typically 18+ but it sucks when its like Bryson Tiller and its 21+. Campus law enforcement and residential life directors/RAs are pretty lenient when it comes to partying. The general rule is to just be chill and avoid unruly people who can't hold their liquor because students party A LOT. St. Louis is dry though...if you think its another midwestern, urban city like Chicago then you're WRONG. Don't be fooled by the pictures in the pamphlets. Moral of the story is to find a group of people who have the same interests as you, which is pretty easy to spot out. I did and we TURNUP.",

Getting involved is a great way to meet a ton of people, find a smaller community within the school, and access resources. Sororities and fraternities have strong support systems for their members in all different areas, academic social or other. They also build mentor type relationships between freshmen and upperclassmen that are awesome to have. At the same time being greek is just a lot of fun and opens up a ton of social events to members while still being pretty low key. Sororities don't have houses at all and most of the guys don't actually live in the frat houses, it's not a huge commitment and definitely doesn't eclipse people's other friend groups.",

It's also common for RAs to fine students $50 every time quiet hours are broken during reading week. Wash U is extremely passionate about honesty and strives to prevent any sort of plagiarism. On the other hand, situations like underage drinking in the dorms are very loosely regulated by RAs.",

There are plenty of activist groups for almost every cause imaginable, and although the school is about 1/3 Jewish and 15% Asian, you don't really think it as you walk through campus and attend class.  There's definitely a good mix of students from a cultural perspective.\r\n\r\nEconomic background is an interesting one.  Everyone acts well-off, even if they're not.  You can't really tell on the surface who has money and who doesn't, which is good and bad.  Good because it's one less thing to worry about, bad because people tend to hide predjudice under guise of anonymity.  But the biggest diversity issue is...\r\n\r\nPolitics.  Wash U, like most of academia, is a left-wing cesspool.  I don't say this to make anyone nervous, because I think it's the same at many places, but you will get slandered as a heartless bigot for being a conservative.  Not a lot, but it will happen at least a couple of times.  I think I have met two or three other like-minded students in the 3 years I've been here.  \r\n\r\nEven the so-called \"College Republicans\" are unabashedly liberal.  If you can hold your own in a political argument, there is much, much fun to be had riling up your fellow students, but if you can't back yourself up with facts, though, it's better to keep your mouth shut.",

Each individual chapter (of both fraternities and sororities) has its unique personality, so going through recruitment is a great idea even if you're not sure you'll like it - you never know where you'll feel at home.

            "Review": "The business school is more preprofessional than any of the other four schools at Wash U. You start learning how to dress and prepare for interviews the first month or two of class. They have incredible resources available to you, the professors are all intelligent, assessable, and eloquent when it comes to teaching, and you can really tell their teaching comes first, even before research. There's always a ton of free food and Olin just opened their newest building this past January. Though it can get competitive at times and you are sometimes compared with your peers as far as grades go, I have absolutely no worries about landing an incredible, stable job to start at after graduation.",

It's to be expected--BME at Wash U, especially coupled with pre-med, is extremely tough. The introductory course for BME (BME 140) is everything like a \"weed-out\" class, and the professor makes little effort to encourage students in their feeble attempts to understand the course material, not to mention any remaining dreams about becoming an engineer. But although challenging, the school of engineering provides so many opportunities for research and internships that those who are genius enough to rise to the top can go far in the field of their choice.",

I enjoyed it, but since I was kind of late to get started, I felt a bit isolated in the senior seminar from some of the other students in the major who had been Environmental Studies majors all along. The major is different now at Wash U, but when I was a part of it, there were 3 tracks -- Biology, Ecology, and Social Science. I chose the Social Science track (less hard science) and was pretty happy with it. It was not a very tough major but it was intellectually stimulating. The three internships I have managed to get since graduating are definitely in line with the purpose of the major (to present environmental issues from a human and societal perspective).",

Even in upper level or curved classes, like many science courses, I find plenty of guidance and support from peers and educators whenever I need it.",

While compared to places not fortunate enough to get wireless access, we are incredibly lucky, it's surprising how slow our internet is and how many problems there are for connecting to it. I guess I think for the amount we pay at Washu, we really should have much better wifi. Printing is great though in general I feel that WashU is oriented more towards macs so that there are more problems with PCs unfortunately.",

Cars are useful, but enough things are accessible through walking, biking, or rental cars that you can get along fine without bringing your own.",

Though to be honest, the campus is small enough where a 15 minute walk at most from one end to the other makes any form of transportation besides walking seem totally pointless. Students are given free passes to take the metro, and this is quite useful when making trips off campus. Usually trips off campus are for grocery/convenience store runs and/or off-campus eating but these are not really as necessary as they are purely fun.",

The advisors, RAs, WUSAs, and other faculty members are always there to offer advice and support whether it's because I had a bad day or because I want to find a research opportunity. Speaking of research, as a research institution it's almost impossible to go for four years without a single research experience in lab. Lastly, WashU offers so many opportunities to get involved. Leadership positions are plentiful and informal clubs are a great way to launch that college debut.",

            "Review": "Wash U really likes to pamper its students, when it comes to facilities. All of the dorms are top-notch, even the oldest ones. The main Olin Library is also very nice, and students will often take naps in there because of the nice environment. Wash U's classroom buildings are also aesthetically pleasing from the outside and are as respectable as any other university's classroom buildings on the inside. The athletic center is old, small, full of concrete, and in need of an update, but sport is not really one of Wash U's main focuses, so many students will only go into the AC a few times in their time at Wash U. Green spaces are pretty good, with a nice Quad and open grass to play soccer and throw frisbees around in other parts of the campus. Hangouts such as Holmes Lounge are nice environments, even if they get overly busy sometimes. Campus activities are not too bad, though there aren't as many student groups as I would have liked and there wasn't as much diversity of them as I thought there could have been (too many a capella groups, for instance). W.I.L.D. is a nice campus event that brings some big-name musical acts to campus (free for all). There aren't all that many traditions at Wash U, though, and the ones that are there are newer than those at some other top universities. There also is no university press, which to me is something that every academically powerful university needs.",

            "Review": "When I was a student in the mid-to-late 2000s, it wasn't that easy to find a computer lab. The vast majority of public computers on campus were at the library. The library, depending on the time of day, could be crowded, leaving people waiting on computers. Printing was free and unlimited in my first few years at Wash U but had transitioned into a limited pay system by the time I was an upperclassman. One could still find a small handful of computer labs that offered free printing, however, like the Mac lab in the old Rubelmann dorm. Most dorms were not equipped with wi-fi when I started out as a student; ethernet was required. Classroom buildings and libraries had wi-fi, I believe, though it wasn't that easy to access. My guess is that wi-fi has expanded at Wash U since I left. I think almost all students had personal laptops but that most people would print using campus printers.",

The campus is small enough that you can barely walk across it without seeing someone you know, but it also has enough people that you can meet interesting people everyday.

Residential colleges promote college spirit and a sense of community through planned outings. With the Loop (Delmar Street) located just one block from campus, and easily accessible by a bridge overpass, students have easy access to off-campus stores and restaurants. On campus, the libraries are modern, the architecture is gorgeous, and there are always great places to hang out. The DUC is a common student haunt, one can find students there nearly all hours it is open: before classes, in between classes, and after class.",

Many students take advantage of the UPass by riding the buses and the Metrorail, both of which reach the vast majority of the areas of St. Louis that are visited by the students. WashU also offers the WeCar program, which allows students to rent cars for a specified number of hours at a reasonable cost. Lastly, many upperclassmen bring cars to campus.",

This past winter was considered mild, but it does snow. Classes are a 10-15 minute walk away from the dorm, so it can be rather annoying to venture to class when it has snowed. Students should also be prepared for possible tornadoes during the spring. Overall, though, the weather in St. Louis does not affect daily activity too much, and students always enjoy good weather during the spring and have fun making snowmen when it snows! The campus is also beautiful after a snowfall.",

I've never heard of anybody exceeding the limit on printing, after which you must pay per page.  The network reliability and speed is very high, except during finals.  The wireless network is pretty good too, although slower than the wired network, and is all over campus. Select outdoor areas even have wireless access, which is nice.  It is possible to go through school without owning a laptop, but I would recommend getting one for convenience's sake.  Wash U provides software for both Windows and Mac.",

The annoying part is that it doesnt snow as much as New York or Boston but it's just as cold. By the beginning of March it starts to get warmer again and by the time you leave in May it's pretty hot. Fall and spring are awesome but the weather changes very quickly, especially in spring. One day it's 70 and tornado watches and then within 24 hours it's like 35.

Since freshmen can't have cars, even though you're given a free UPass to use the metro, it is very difficult to go to the Soulard district, Tower Grove Park on Grand, Olive Street, Cherokee Street, etc. Also, there is always so much schoolwork and things happening around campus, many people never leave or experience much of St. Louis at all. However, I do feel very safe on campus, it's beautiful, the Loop is an awesome place to walk to for dinner and maybe a concert at the Pageant that always has great bands coming.

Don't be lazy, take the Metro to and from Lambert Airport. It's not a far walk at all and it will save you a ton of money, especially if you can't find anyone to split a cab with you. WashU is in a nice part of town, you will not be mugged on your way to the MetroLink station. That being said, the Metro is not good enough to get you to every part of the city. Taxis are needed especially if you are going to bars/clubs as a freshman (b/c frosh can't have their own car).",

It was recently rated one of the top ten streets in America and has lots of local restaurants as well as some chains restaurants and ethnic cuisine. I recommend Pi pizzeria, which is so good that president Obama had their pizza flown to the white house.   If you are looking for a more variety in ethnic food head down to the central west end (10 minute by the metro) to sample a wider variety. If your looking for something classy head to Clayton(5 minutes by car). There are also lots of places in the area that deliver.",

Prices are pretty expensive, but there is a lot of variety in terms of cuisines and healthy options. 2 dining areas (Bear's Den & Village House) by the dorms are open really late into the night, so students can always grab some food in the middle of their late night studying. Everything is based on a meal point plan that decreases in amount by the price of the food. WashU's dining isn't buffet/swipe style like most other colleges. Instead, you pick whatever food you want off a menu and pay for it on your way out.",

With a variety of ethnic food restaurants (from Chinese, to Thai, to Middle Eastern, including kosher options), as well as American food staples, the Loop has dining for everyone. Located a ten to fifteen minute walk from main campus, the Loop is easy to get to. There are discounts at some stores, and more shops are beginning to accept \"Bear Bucks\", which students can load onto their ID cards from their student accounts to make paying for laundry, school supplies, etc. easier.

The loop is full of different cuisine to choose from (ranging from american to thai to japanese to chinese) and if you have a car, more options such as indian mexican korean etc are available. take the bus to brentwood (rides are free) for organic shops or department store food courts. the cheesecake factory (they sell tons more than just dessert) is a good bet in the area.",

The dorms are decently spacious and there is a nice field and volleyball court and basketball court there too. Some of the traditional dorms are kind of run down, but the moderns are really nice. The worst dorm hands down is Rubleman House (we call it Ruby). The best for freshmen is Umrath House, and the best for sophomores and upperclassmen who still live on the 40 is South Forty House (SoFoHo). Ironically, they are all a par of the same residential college (groupings of houses, usually with their own colors and mascots and consist usually of a freshman and sophomore building). Most all of the housing is kind of expensive though.",

Dorms are convenient, very close to campus, and dorms are grouped together by year to make socializing easy.",

Off-campus housing is usually accessible and generally cheaper than on-campus housing. However, University City is not the safest of areas, and thus, there is a safety concern when considering late-nights spent on campus.",

While the new applies to the modern dorms, the traditional dorms have a reputation for fostering a great community (modern do as well it's just something traditionals pride themselves in) so it's a win-win either way.  Sophomores have the luxury of suite-style housing either opting for a newer modern with four people per suite or a slightly older but balcony-included six-person living situation.  Between tempurpedic mattresses, spacious rooms, and the inclusive environment of the South 40, WashU students truly have it all when it comes to housing.",
