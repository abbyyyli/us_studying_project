Everyone here is also very work-hard play-hard, so it's definitely something that is helpful to learn along the way. The students here are extremely smart, but humble as well, so it's not a super competitive/stressful environment; rather, you can pursue what you're interested in.",

Mostly if the weather conditions is I think it is good. I am afraid of Avery cold freezy season. Always am concerned about the climate and the food we are eating. Because may not be suitable with my condition. I am not sure but I love normal weather. Even though about the food l like ballance food with everything's. Maybe some thing to adapt to some things you don't know before that's not easier to adapt. With people also maybe easier.\nYou know mostly l am talking about the food why I don't know. What is my aim perpose is this for food or my education dream. Yes my graduation dream but by the way l like to mention regarding the food we are eating. Some tames if we are concentrated our delicious foods and spices do think is this harmful to our body. I mean the same like toxins to our healthy. Like high sodium and sugar too.",

The rigorous academics, coupled with access to world-class faculty, have pushed me to think critically and explore areas of study I never imagined I would pursue. The campus is stunning, and the vibrant community creates an environment that fosters collaboration and innovation.\n\nOne of the things I truly appreciate about Duke is its interdisciplinary focus. Whether through specialized courses, research opportunities, or extracurricular activities, students are encouraged to break traditional academic boundaries. Organizations like the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative or programs like Bass Connections allow for hands-on experiences that prepare you for real-world challenges.",

That rush to judgment by those professors before the Facts were know, highlights the bigotry and narrow mindedness of some of Dukes staff then and now .

There are tutors available almost at your convenience, professors are always willing to help, and communities are ready to take you into their loving arms. I love the campus and the community. I found people I know I can depend on when times get tough and that's another line of support I've solidified in the past few months. I can't even think of a major complaint I would have towards this school, Duke is not perfect but it's accommodating and a lovely experience that I can't wait to see more of. I still get homesick and worry about my future, but I honestly feel Duke will ensure I achieve whatever dream I strive for. If Duke has what you're looking for, I wouldn't hesitate to give it a chance.",

Professors are, for the most part, helpful and encouraging but you need to find the right ones, as there are a handful that are stuck in their ways and have biased political or social agendas, which spills over into how they evaluate students academically. Academic isolationism between departments is a challenge that impedes innovation, but I appreciate that Duke has interdisciplinary initiatives to break down these walls. Overall a fantastic school with great name brand and prowess, but one that can think more about true social progress and provide more holistic support to students' development, and not just their careers.",

I would like to see improvement in the social experience. Since Greek life has been removed from campus, parties are now less safe as they are held in remote fields far away from campus often without cellular service.  Bringing the fraternities and sororities back on campus would create a safer social environment as they will continue to stay alive, whether on or off campus. When the administration attempts to break up parties and remove them from campus, it only serves to make them more exclusive, therefore creating a hierarchical social pyramid where many students feel excluded.",

However, Durham was not super safe, and the school was very Greek focused for an academically rigorous institution. It was hard to be socially accepted if you were not in a fraternity.",

The community at Duke is filled with goal-oriented, friendly, and intelligent individuals, all of whom have inspired and motivated me to strive for excellence. Moreover, Duke's commitment to providing outstanding academic resources has been a game-changer for me.

            "Review": "Duke is an incredible school that combines academic rigour and a social place with many extracurricular opportunities. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate, and the food is also correctly rated as one of the best in the nation. The interdisciplinary nature of Duke allows incoming students to learn more than just their intended major and gain valuable academic, social and life skills by the time they graduate. The culture at Duke stimulates an atmosphere of doing your best while also having fun so it is the best for students who have those goals. The professors are funny and insightful, helping you fall in love with every class. There are some improvements needed such as the Quad-Ex housing system, however, it is a relatively new system introduced and I am sure it will improve over time. Duke has everything you can ask for in a university and my short experience has been wonderful. The people, places and projects there will help you settle in quickly.",

            "Review": "I think Duke University is a fantastic institution that truly cares about its students' success. Academics are quite difficult, yes, but there are countless resources for those that need them. I wish the administration listened more to students, though. Sometimes it feels like our critiques are never listened to, especially ones from our BIPOC, women-identifying, and LGBTQ+ populations. I don't think it's fair that tuition increases every year either, especially since we're not seeing a correlated increase in the quality of our education or standard of living. QuadEx is an awful program that should never have been implemented, some of our favorite restaurants have been closed down, and the campus transportation system is really quite awful, which affects pretty much every other aspect of life on campus. However, I know that things can be better and I know that at its heart, Duke is an institution that cares about us and if we can make our voices heard, perhaps things can change.",

At Duke, everyone strives for academic excellence, and as a student-athlete, I strive for both academic and athletic excellence. My point of view is a little different for most of the student population, but I still believe it is valuable nonetheless. There are many different aspects to like at Duke University. A few include: the sense of community, the strive for excellence, the beautiful campus, the city of Durham, etc. There is always lots to do, and because the university is on the smaller side, there are lots of familiar faces to see (and therefore many friends to make). There are a few things that might need some changing. These include: the bus system and the parking.  I would like to see more buses running throughout the day to make it easier to get to class without leaving your room 20 minutes before. I also think there is never enough parking available! These are common complaints on campus!",

The Trinity College of Arts and Sciences offer a variety of majors, and the Pratt School of Engineering offers four engineering majors.  The engineering school is rather small, especially for civil and environmental engineering that one's experience may be a little limited.  Professor quality is very good overall; because it is a research institution though, there are many professors who are more research-oriented than good at teaching.  Good multi-tiered advising system for those with generic academic interests or undecided track.  Student life isn't as dominated by Greek life as other schools that it makes it easier to find one's \"own crowd\"",

The professors are really invested in your education. Parking is HORRIBLE if you do not time it right or try to get around without a parking pass. The parking lots are a good walk away from the buildings most of the time so add walking time to your commute if you are a grad student. Student Health is phenomenal. Cocoa Cinnamon is a great coffee shop that everyone should try at least once to get coffee (tea or hot chocolate) and churros. The city of Durham is beautiful so explore it if you get a chance.",

Many of Duke's majors/minors are flexible and easy to combine, so I was able to study what truly interested me while still getting a well-rounded education. The strong level of professor engagement also sets Duke apart; I became close with many of my professors who served as mentors, advisors, and friends throughout college and even now after graduation. It's easy to get involved with research, study abroad, or engage in other opportunities that interest you. Duke has a diverse social scene, so there really is a place for everyone, but it can be challenging to navigate the selective organizations. There are hundreds of student groups to join, and most have strong social components too. The food and campus living environment are both superb, and the city of Durham is nearby and nice as well. Duke grads have numerous post-grad opportunities, and I was able to get a great job.",

Likewise, there's a 24-hour eatery and off-campus delivery options that you can pay for (Papa Johns, Sushi Love, TGIF, Chinese, Mediterra, etc.) WITH FOOD POINTS!! Obviously basketball season is crazy and amazing; campus is super lively. Football games are also fun and don't get enough credit. Campus is beautiful and dorms are super nice and constantly renovated.

There are so many things to do to make the most of your college experience.  \n\nNearly every aspect of student life at Duke falls into the \"Goldilocks Zone\" in terms of not being too little or too much, but being \"just right\".\n\nThe best part about being a Duke student is having the power to make the most out of every moment presented to you.

Its campus is BEAUTIFUL; we have lush gardens and there are so many birds here, from towhees to even the occasional hawk. The opportunities here to get involved are almost overwhelming. We have this program called DukeEngage where students go to all parts of the world to work with communities through research and volunteer work. I will actually be going to Costa Rica this summer to help in rainforest restoratuon and conservation through this  program!But what I truly love most about this school is its students. The atmosphere here is not competitive but collaborative. I came to Duke feeling insecure about my qualifications compared to those of the other incoming freshman. But never once did I feel belittled or patronized. Students here want each other to succeed, we want to see each other grow and challenge ourselves to improve. Here at Duke, 'Southern Hospitality' is the real deal!",

Sports are generally a big deal on campus (sports = basketball), and the food is good. It can feel a bit like a bubble though -- Durham is a city rich with life and growth, and while a lot of students don't venture into downtown much, I would recommend it. It has a great food and arts scene, as well as local grassroots organizations who deeply care about improving Durham.",

With that in mind, many minorities complain but do not realize that this representation is a reality, this is how the rest of the U.S. is regarding variety. It is very diverse in comparison to so many other colleges around the United States. Furthermore, Duke has a plethora of international students ranging from countries like Zambia to Venezuela.\nThe West campus is gorgeous and East Campus is inviting, but Central Campus is extremely ugly.

The flexible pathway through Duke is one of its best features, and it guarantees there's something academic for nearly everyone here. Not to mention everything that goes on outside of academics. Whether you're a performance artist, coder, engineer, service-learner, researcher, intense athlete, or a just for fun one, there's a place for you here. If you're anything at all, and looking to challenge yourself, then come to Duke!",

When basketball season begins, students camp out on the K-ville lawn in front of one of our gyms in order to receive tickets to our rival basketball game against University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Duke also has a football team that is on the rise, and the games are full of students cheering on their fellow players. Other sports, such as Women's soccer and Lacrosse, are incredibly great, but they don't receive the praise that basketball and football do.

Otherwise, it exercises considerable (and appreciated) leniency for students who operate on an \"all things in moderation\" principle. If a student becomes incapacitated, for example, the campus police's first directive is to secure that student's safety and wellbeing. From an academic standpoint, Duke abides by the honor code to which all students pledge. Of all the offenses one could incur, plagiarism is usually the most dire.",

However, those activities are largely homogenous; if your interests extend beyond aimlessly drinking in the fraternity and sorority houses with an occasional dose of formal events, alternatives are certainly available. Selective living groups (SLGs) constitute another avenue of fostering a communal atmosphere among students. Ostensibly, they are more accepting and diverse in purpose than the Greek organizations.",

You find a diverse mix of types at Duke, ranging from preppy, alpha male types to extremely nerdy individuals.

At Duke it provides a tightly-knit group of friends and numerous social opportunities.However, it does not seclude you from friends in other fraternities or non-Greek students. Some of my best friends are in different fraternities and they hang out in my section frequently.

But instead, the system produces a very noticeable caste system, where top frats and sororities compete for status, while the overall feeling towards non greek students can be a bit concerning. Instead of fostering a community where everyone is included, you feel the need to join any frat or sorority in order to not be left out of the party scene.

There are SLGs (selective living groups), which are essentially co-ed housing groups that have a rush process and select whom they would like to become members, but their budgets are minimal, as is their control of the social scene.\r\nThere is a slew of fraternities, and if you play the rush process even reasonably intelligently, you'll have no problem getting a bid. Girls are guaranteed bids if they simply play by the rush rules of the Panhellic Council.  Greek life is divisive at Duke, as it is at all schools that have it.  Although the social scene might be better and more diverse if the Greek system didn't exist at Duke, it does exist, and it has a generally positive impact on the opportunities in the form of parties, mixers, pregames, formals and venue rent-outs. There's a range of fraternities and sororities, and a social hierarchy absolutely exists, but most people are secure with where they are and enjoy their social experience it seems. The Greek system at Duke is overall solid. There is no \"frat row,\" though, and Greek housing consists of fraternity and sorority members living together in a section of a dormitory or central campus apartment complex.",

The East campus is a dry campus, so if you're caught with alcohol you can be cited, but its not uncommon for people to drink on east and get away with it. West campus is the exact opposite of East. You're allowed to have 6 beers on you at a time in the open on east, even if you're underage, without any repurcussions. The real problem like any school is breaking the honor code. If you are caught cheating you are in a world of trouble.",

Only about a fourth of guys and a third of girls go greek, with the rest staying independent or joining SLGs (selective living groups). SLG's are a great alternative to greek life and offer the same kind of social/intellectual community without the same intensity or a national affiliation. Especially first semester, all frat parties are open to the whole school and you will rarely if ever be turned down to get in one. Sororities don't live together in sections like the frats do, bust most girls choose to block with girls in the same sorority. I've find that a lot of frat guys and sorority girls really break the stereotype for greeks.",

East Campus houses all undergraduate students during their first year and grants freshman space to become acclimated to the college lifestyle amongst themselves.  Everyone living on East is under 21 and the campus is strictly dry as a result.\r\nIn contrast West Campus, which is home to most juniors and sophomores, has a very loose drinking policy.  This dichotomy on alcohol policy creates a unique nightlife environment.  West campus is where all the parties are because, frankly, a freshman could pound a beer in front of a cop without repercussion. East's tighter regulation means that, even on a Saturday night, the space is relatively quiet.  I think it's great; as a freshman, I had a safe and fun place to drink and a quiet place to sleep and work.",

If you are looking to go into finance, Rasiel is your best resource. She is extremely committed to the students and brings in an abundance of financial firms.",

The classes are generally challenging and not boring. With the close affiliation of the medical school there are more opportunities for grad level academics (i.e. Human Anatomy with a human cadaver lab). There are tremendous opportunities for research that could lead to an authorship on a paper. Very helpful to student athletes.",

Because many students who choose this major are pre- med with the intention of going to medical school, many of the courses are run accordingly.

Then again, I personally lean towards the humanities and social sciences and am still very content with the offerings.  \r\n\r\nThe workload differs from person to person, however the general consensus is that being a Duke student means having to do work (especially if you are an engineer or pre-med).

Especially among this century's additions, new structures are painstakingly tailored to complement Duke's stylistic character (Neo-Gothic on West, Collegiate Georgian on East). Athletic facilities are worthy of the Blue Devils' distinguished reputations, and the library system ranks among the country's most comprehensive. Undergraduates assume ownership of student programming campaigns, a logical but unusual allowance that dates to the 1950s. It is not uncommon for student leaders to directly oversee 5- to 6-figure programming budgets.",

DPAC, for example, now hosts all of the touring Broadway shows and many of the major concert acts that visit the Triangle region.

I haven't spent a lot of time off campus, although I know there is plenty to do. The city is really accessible, because they have free buses going throughout Durham. There's a farmer's market every Saturday, where a lot of people in the community go to. It feels really southern and quaint. There's a stereotype that Duke is full of obnoxious, privileged kids, and basically everyone in North Carolina hates Duke because UNC is our huge rival. Knowing the people here, I wouldn't agree with that stereotype at all. Everyone's proud of going to Duke, but they don't really shove that in people's faces or flaunt it.",

There are pockets of increasing urbanization/gentrification (like Brightleaf, the American Tobacco District, the Warehouse District), but there are also huge swaths of intense poverty. The yuppie Durham community seems pretty intent on either ignoring the problems facing lower-income residents or just advocating for more police presence, neither or which do much to build positive relationships among the entire town.",

With the professors, researchers, visiting recruiters, and established alumni who prefer hiring \"Dukies\", you've got a vital system set in place to help you succeed. There's such variety at Duke that you can find yourself ready and set for Law/Medical School, or you can take an offer as a computer systems analyst, or you can travel the world for archaeological digs. Duke's art/dance/music programs are also fantastic so don't think you're limited to the sciences and humanities.",

When I got here is when I realized that school is not a competition. I realized that I was where I needed to be when I met people and became friends with people that were way smarter than I am. Every day is a challenge, but getting that degree is so worth it.",

You actually know THE subject; you've not only been taught the inner workings and concepts of it, but also how to produce new theories and pieces of knowledge within the subject area yourself. Duke trains you with research, internships, and hands-on opportunities that allow you to raise your questions and find the answers to them. That, in my opinion, is an in-depth way of learning.",

One of the university's leading assets is its alumni network, which has been carefully cultivated over many decades.

But it's horrible that you don't get that many food points to start with and you can only really eat in one place everyday. Also you have to miss two meals if you want brunch and dinner on weekends. After freshmen year you can have any meal plan size you want and there are tons of food options to select from. The only comment I really have with Duke Dinning, is that beyond Divinity there aren't that many healthy food options, and Divinity is no longer open for dinner.",

On central there is only Food Fac, but it's great. You can buy drinks (non-alcoholic and alcoholic) and snacks on food points there too.\r\n\r\nFood points come in many different plans. Freshman get \"swipes\" to use at the Marketplace and around 400 food points. Sophomores and up can choose a plan with 1700-3000 points and more can always be added very easily.",

The Marketplace has great breakfast and brunch, but some people complain that the dinner gets old. On West campus, however, there are so many great places to eat that the food never gets old. There is the great hall which offers a la carte food, then restaurants like Au Bon Pain, Chick Fil-A, Alpine Bagels, The Loop (pizza and grill), and more. Not to mention the Divinity and Law School refectories are God's gift to this earth.",

The Refectory provides a delicious brunch option, while the Blue Express provides great home cooked meals. However, the Marketplace, the only dining hall on east, doesn't have the best quality of meals. Plus, all freshman are required to purchase a dining plan which forces students to eat dinner there almost every night of the week. This proves troublesome when students are required to stay on West, since it is the hub of campus activities. Therefore, a night spent eating on West due to a club meeting, studying, or a concert means students are literally throwing away $14--the, overpriced, cost of dinner at the marketplace. Besides this one issue campus dining is overall satisfying.",

Some dorms, such as Bell Tower, are incredibly well-kept, new, have wonderful amenities, and really feel like home. Others look a bit run-down and have more trouble happening inside. As a sophomore and up, you have the option to choose where you'd like to live. You can 'rush' for a Selective Living Group (SLG) which is not a frat or sorority, more like, a dorm where people who have the same interests and values can live together. You can also choose to live in a dorm that accepts substance use, like alcohol, if you would like a place where others enjoy drinking, and you can choose a substance-free dorm as well. It all depends on your preferences. A triple room, with three beds, is the least expensive, with a single room being the most expensive. The housing process for freshman is simple, since you don't choose, and it gets a little complex as you get older, since you have to decided where to live and what to do if you want to live there.",

            "Review": "Duke campus housing is pretty good. As a freshmen housing assignment is random and most dorms are nice except two (that tend to be really small). Beyond freshmen you have the option to live on West Campus or Central Campus based on your rankings. Usually you will get one of your 3 top choices. You are then assigned a lottery number based on your year, and even the lowest lottery numbers (like I had last year) get you a pretty good room. While roommate assignments are not always the best, I haven't had too bad of an experience, and you technically choose your own roommate. I ended up living in Few which I think is an awesome dorm, and I got to block with my friends. The dorm is in one of the best locations and the rooms are A/Ced and a reasonable size.",

The new housing model tried to rectify this, but it just ends up confusing.  Freshman dorms are great - everyone loves living on East Campus - but it can be disorienting to move off of East sophomore year and find your friends scattered around West and Central. This is a big reason for the sophomore slump.  You can end up living in Few with AC and nice rooms...or in Wannamaker with a no-substance policy, no AC, and far from everything. It's Russian Roulette.",

That takes away a lot of the stress that my friends from other schools are facing from trying to find reasonably priced off campus housing. There is a wide range of housing options, from Central Campus apartment-style, to new, air-conditioned dorms, to dorms with classic Gothic architecture. Rooms tend to be quite spacious, or at least mine is. The freshman live on their own campus, which has its ups and downs. The positive part of that is that you get a great sense of community since you know everyone you're living with is going through the same adjustment to college period you're going through. The downside is location--you're further away from the West campus classes, but buses only take about 5-10 minutes to go back and forth between campuses, and buses come very regularly while class is in session (during the daytime). Plus, you're closer to 9th street, where there are restaurants and grocery stores.",

However, as of this year the Duke housing model changed so it is hard to rate, or even explain, housing at the moment. After the transition, I'm sure it will be great.",

The issue might be distance, especially if you don't have a car but buses and Duke transit can take you to some buildings. The off campus housing can range from very nice, spacious apartments to pretty rundown but either way the price is significantly lower than at most top schools or anything in a city.",

            "Review": "Join Dorms With Selective Living Groups – The best part about living on campus is being a part of a selective living group, where your dorm truly becomes your community and you can create the best social atmosphere. The first years live separately on a different campus and there, you really bond with your class. But after you move to the upperclassmen campus, there are so many dorms to choose from. Most are spacious, have air conditioning, are extremely convenient and close to restaurants, the library, class buildings, etc. You can live in a single, double, or triple, the former being the most expensive. Once you are a junior or senior, you have the option of living off campus. Also, students have the choice of living in apartment style housing.",

Three have AC, and one, Belltower, is the newest and literally feels like a hotel. Don't let the aesthetics speak for themselves, though: the people really do make the dorm. Sororities just got housing, and they implemented a new housing system, so it will change a lot in the future years for upperclassmen.",

You have your own library, cafeteria, gym and more. It's a great place to begin your college experience. West Campus is primarily for sophomores but there are juniors and seniors who do live on the campus. It's great living on West Campus because everything is accessible: classes, food options, library. Then there's Central Campus, which is the worst. Central is comprised of one, two and four person apartments. It's isolated from the rest of campus, the buses are always late and the apartment facilities are subpar.",

Freshman year I lived in Gilbert-Addoms, the biggest and ugliest dorm on East Campus. Despite the lack of AC and amenities, I loved my time in Gilbert-Addoms. The fact the East is only freshman creates a great atmosphere that really encourages the formation of friendships and socialization. East is located right by downtown Durham and the social atmosphere was wonderful. Next year i'll be living in Edens. The rooms and closets are not always spacious, the windows are minimal, and the floorplan seems both illogical and labyrinthine. AC is a saving grace.",

At Duke, we don't get the chance to live off campus until we are seniors, which seems sensible to me with the good setup we have on campus.
