The Georgetown neighborhood is also one of the best neighborhoods in DC and there are unparalleled opportunities for internships by just being in DC.

I have never lived outside the Detroit-metropolitan area, so moving to Washing D.C. was a great experience to find new urban living while also having a secure study environment to pursue my degree. I think the only downside is that bias exists in higher institutions and this was apparent at Georgetown. Only a small fraction of students are people of color and I have the experience of being around professors and staff who are not comfortable around people of color attending the institution. However, I don't believe their opinion's accurately capture the whole university and students can find community all over that will accept them. University life will always be challenging, especially for low-income students of color, but the academic quality you will receive from the school is still worth pursuing.",

Campus life is vibrant, especially regarding clubs and organizations. Most students are involved in multiple clubs, finding community in various spaces on campus. Many clubs are preprofessional, which has both benefits and drawbacks; they can help students discover their passions and potential career paths early on, but may also cause stress if students feel pressured to join enough preprofessional clubs. The surrounding D.C. area is beautiful and full of activities, enhancing the college experience. One thing that stands out is the incredible faculty. Professors are not only experts in their fields but most are adjunct so they are active leaders in their fields. I appreciate learning from professionals that are passionate about their fields of study and academia.",

            "Review": "The online SCS program at Georgetown was awful.  It practically costs as much as normal tuition, yet there is very little one-on-one with professors.  Not to mention the fact that the administration is full of terrible people, who do not care about students.  I dropped out after my first course because it was not worth the money, and they charged me for another-- even though I withdrew and never submitted a single assignment.  When I told them that, they referred my case to a debt collector and destroyed my credit score.  Now, I have to get a Lawyer involved (which I cannot afford).  I wish they would let me give ZERO stars.  Dont pay to get a degree here.",

I love the course material and the fast paced classes - all the professors I’ve had are very good at what they do, interesting, qualified. I liked the many coffeeshops and easy access to the city. I disliked that campus parties are often boring, the lack of solid sports culture, and people that like to hear their own voices but don’t contribute anything to the conversation that isn’t pretentious and convoluted.",

I met some wonderful instructors with whom I'm stay in touch. The administrative staff or other non-teaching staff can improve in supporting students and setting them up for success. As a disabled student, I had to jump through the hoops to get \"accommodations,\" which I received only after my first two semesters. In my first two semesters, I got up to 20 percent of possible points for assignments deducted just for submitting those 5-15 minutes late. I couldn't get paperwork in for requesting accommodations because Georgetown required the professional who wrote a letter supporting my request to be a Ph-D level, which would be a barrier to a person on Medicaid. Fast forward, I finally got accommodations, until they lost/ misplaced my documentations or they got me mixed up with another student. Other inadequate admin/ communication issues also impacted me.",

However, because of the flexibility that the professors had, I was able to succeed in class.

Teaching staff, social scene, academic offers outside of the classroom (speaker, events, etc), traditions, and the surrounding area make Georgetown incredibly special.

Everyone is super hardworking, optimistic/grounded (none of the Ivy snark or pessimism), and most importantly looking to give back. I’m not catholic (I’m frankly not even religious), but the Jesuit values and inclusive nature of the school gives a one of a kind education for the mind, body, and soul.

Parties on campus can be  okayish (DC substances, raves and bars in dc are much better imo) and not super lively in general esp if you compare to other schools even those within this academic class. Being rich helps a lot, which many students are, and the elitism is easy to avoid if you know what to watch out for. Applying to clubs and doing interviews was kinda dumb even after getting in and doing interviews to other people and just felt wrong when just trying to explore new interests.

Just like home it is far from being perfect but it’s home. \nYes some people are preppy AF, yes it is a PWI, yes there are some republicans, and yes the food and dorms suck sometimes. \nAs a hispanic and queer student the change to living in georgetown was abrupt but I wouldn’t change my college decision. \nThere is a community for everyone, for as small as it may be. \nGeorgetown is diverse not in number but in people, there are a lot of different types of people. \nDC is a great city and there are other colleges around if you ever get bored. The party scene is pretty good \nIt is academically rigorous, some professors are literally world renowned. \nIf you plan to study politics or business there is hardly a better school to go to.",

I met a lot of hardworking yet fun people, all of whom I learned something from whether that be for a class, on M Street, or at a townhouse party. I came to Georgetown for the international affairs type classes/program within the SFS, and the classes I have taken in those regards have exceeded my expectations. While the campus could use some work, the neighborhood is great; the area and DC generally are great for exploring. Soccer was a big highlight for me in terms of athletics. Getting to go to the College Cup was such a fun experience. What isn't as fun is managing the one dining hall, although I suppose I got used to it over time and it allowed me to catch up with friends. As a person of color, I will say diversity isn't great, but I have still been able to find friends from many different backgrounds. So, while there is room for the school to improve, I'm excited for what Georgetown has in store in the coming years.",

I’m not the biggest fan of the administration and found them quite unhelpful. You are kind of on your own when it comes to your academic path, and the school is not flexible when switching your course of study/studying across disciplines. Nevertheless, students are very collaborative and will help you find opportunities that will excite you even if the administration is not coherent enough to do so.",

The professors are all experts in their fields, classes are a great size, and the people here (mostly) are wonderful. Despite the occasional elitist boarding school kid, the atmosphere here is great. I have truly found my best friends here, and I wouldn’t change a thing. Highly recommend checking rate my professor before choosing classes! The one thing I will complain about is the competitive club culture, but I have been able to find incredible extracurriculars that aren’t toxic and exclusive. Also, it’s cliché, but the location cannot be beat. I always have something to do in the city, and most of the museums downtown are free, so weekends are always jam packed. Definitely worth the money, in my opinion.",

If you are an explorer at heart, and someone who seeks the path less traveled, understand that Georgetown students are largely conformists—they have frankly, chosen to view college as a time to fortify their path to that coveted position at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIf you identify with a public school background, or express yourself as a creative individual through clothing, hobbies, music, etc., understand that Georgetown will resemble an alien world of Exeter (or Deerfield, or Riverdale, or Andover...) sweatshirts and vineyard vines, amalgamating into one frustrating, relentlessly vanilla, pre-professional mass.

The administration does not truly invest into these two areas as much as they claim, and as a result, it has a negative impact on the physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing of the student body.

For a school of about 7000 undergraduates, there's only one dining hall, and the meal plans are way too expensive. Everything has an added fee (like the gym and laundry). Georgetown has a pretty big endowment, but it expects us to pay for everything. Overall, I wasn't very pleased with my first year. Social life sucks and clubs are extremely competitive to join.",

Professors DO seem preoccupied with their research, but most genuinely care about students. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the university is connected to how pre-professional it is. This can translated to club culture. People are more focused on getting jobs after graduation than most other schools. This is connected to Georgetown's return on investment, however. Well worth coming!",

The religious aspects of the college are surprising really low-key and very relaxed- the most its 'super apparent' is that you have to take two theology courses as apart of your core, but they're really diverse and stimulating. The club culture may seem overwhelming to new students, but you'll find your niche in no time. \nThe food on campus... Is hit or miss(I guess they never miss huh?). While there's sadly only one dining hall on campus, its not too bad.\nDorm life is great. And no, Darnall Hall is not THAT bad.\nYou'll work hard here, for sure.

Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat. Rather, the school makes a concerted and largely successful effort to instill Jesuit values into all aspects of the community, such as the values of empathy, care, and intellectual risk-taking.",

It is my hope that cost to attend be brought to an affordable measure as it stands right now there is constant stress as to how to pay tuition let alone books and overall coat of living. A good education should come unreasonably priced especially for those adult learners wanted to improve their lives through education.",

In terms of the two big college sports, football and basketball, Georgetown has a weak football team, but a perennially strong basketball team. Sure, we haven't been to the final four since 2007, but making March Madness is usually a sure bet. More importantly, people really care about the team, and that's what makes the games fun! Facilities are pretty good too. There is a new varsity athletic facility under construction, which will be good for varsity teams and will hopefully take some traffic away from Yates, the main campus gym.",

If you are caught with alcohol underage, you will probably get something like academic probation rather than suspension or expulsion, so it is not exactly as strict as zero-tolerance. Georgetown also has medical amnesty (if you are drunk and call the campus police or our ambulance for help, you will not get in trouble). I think drug policies are more strict.

Georgetown is a Catholic school, but has a significant number of Jewish students, Muslim students, and students of other religions. A lot of students are well-to-do, yes, but I also have several friends who were homeless in high school. The community is completely accepting of LGBT, I've never met anybody who didn't accept someone for being gay, and we have a pretty large LGBT population. There are tons of international students and a higher rate of minorities than most other top-tier or Catholic schools. People are open to dialogue about differing backgrounds too, and don't just stick to hanging out with people from their ethnic group.",

Most games are actually really well attended and are really fun- students stand on the field and cheer from the sidelines. \r\n\r\nSailing is by far the most underrated sport. Sailing holds 17 of our school's 18 national championships (the last being basketball) and this year Georgetown won the world championship. Yea, we're the best in the world and a lot of people don't even know there's a sailing team. \r\n\r\nBasketball is really the main sport. We're traditionally a basketball school-- we may have sucked in 2014, but 2015 is already looking better. Games are usually well attended and pretty fun.

There are a number of co-ed greek organizations on campus that actually are university approved, like DPE, the foreign service frat, and APO, the community service frat, but the single-sex social frats are not. Of the social greek clubs, there's 2 sororities and 3 fraternities. They have a somewhat big presence for organizations that aren't university recognized, but mainly because they table in Red Square every week and set up cornhole games on the front lawn. They organize some charity events like 5k fundraisers too, but really all they do is throw parties. They're actually usually pretty chill about who they let in, so it's really not your typical douchey frat scene.",

There's a lot of diversity (a lot more than people seem to think, more than any other school I've visited) so you have a lot of different, but all good looking people. And yes, a lot of people do dress preppy, but there's definitely way more people who dress hipster-y or super trendy than preppy. Most people are more concerned with their studies than how they look, however, so you don't have a lot of the seemingly perfect, borderline trashy, stereotypical hot chicks as you do at big fratty state schools, but you also get a lot less people walking around in pajamas. Campus is also low-key a lot more sexually active than you would expect from a top-tier Catholic school. People gotta de-stress from that heavy courseload somehow. Lots of random or casual hookups, and then consistent hookups that turn into serious relationships, but almost nothing in between. There is zero casual dating.",

            "Review": "If you know anything about Georgetown, you know about the Hoyas. Despite our disappointing performance during the last few seasons, we're still known for our basketball, and students continue to take pride in the program. It's an absolute must to go to at least a few basketball games during your time here -- as one of the only things that the entire student body rallies around, the energy is unmatched. As for facilities, most students will find Yates sufficient (albeit far). Club sports can be lots of fun if you've recruited the right teammates, although the organization (and some of the fields you'll be forced to play on) can be a little sketchy.",

While there are tons of good, genuine people to connect with if you are actively seeking them out, the image of the Vineyard Vines-clad, designer umbrella-toting, East Coast lax bro/sorority girl remains a dominant stereotype, often times referenced in contexts of humorous self-depraction. The key is to not get caught up in generalizations; if successful, you'll find that most people here, when you look beyond the pastels, are more than meets the eye.",

There are numerous frats and sororities unsponsored by the university. Most students do not belong to a frat, and most parties are not thrown by Greek groups. Friends tell me that joining a frat can be a fun and rewarding social option, but it is definitely not necessary or expected.",

Parties are occasionally broken up, and noise violations can be an issue because the Georgetown community is hostile towards the university. Students are allowed in each others' dorms at all hours, but must be signed in by a resident after midnight. There are a few free speech zones on campus, but in other areas, groups can be prevented from protesting or tabling. Georgetown is a Catholic university, so contraception is not sold on campus and the university will not fund or recognize pro-choice groups.",

There's a sporty atmosphere so quite a few students hit the gym often; however, the library is never empty (and the 2nd floor study space's coffee shop makes it a social hangout). \r\n\r\nMost social interactions take place through clubs and campus groups (ask any Georgetown student what they're involved in on-campus and you'll get a list of at least 4 clubs and/or a sports team). The campus groups are often the ones hosting the parties, but at the same time, they give you a chance to know guys and girls pretty well through daytime activities. So, on one hand, the party scene is pretty large and relaxed, so hookups happen often. On another hand, couples are not uncommon or actively discouraged on campus. And on yet another hand, you'll find that most of the Georgetown populace have friends of the other gender without difficulty.\r\n\r\nNote: Freshman boy syndrome is present (the theory is that girls date up the ranks, leaving freshman guys the least desirable species on campus), but they are not actively excluded from the party scene.",

One thing you should know about Georgetown is that it's probably not for everyone.

Even professors who do conduct research through the university seem to place teaching as their top priority. Because these teachers are so passionate, the workload is pretty rigorous but also rewarding. The professors are very available outside of class and are very willing to go the extra mile to help a student. Additionally, Georgetown has a lot of student run tutoring centers that are free. Overall, there a lot of resources for students if they chose to use them. The aspect of academic life at Georgetown that I have been most impressed by so far is that my professors teach in a way that is highly applicable; they aren't just teaching us for the sake of giving us knowledge. Instead, they actually want us to be able to use and apply what we learn to help people.",

Thees are both lab sciences and not only require a lot of work but also a lot of class time. A lot of kids drop after first semester or during second semester. However, if science is what you love, it is great because I would take two sciences over two writing courses any day. Biology is set up well - the lab section and lecture are connected, making biology a 5 credit course. This allows the material to flow nicely and for one to grasp it well. However, chemistry is separated into a 3 credit lecture and a 2 credit lab. This is not run well because there are two lecture professors, so one lab section is being quizzed on the same material although half the class may not have learned it yet. Also, it has happened that we have done a lab on a subject that neither section of lecture had yet covered.",

However, if one actively tries to break the \"Georgetown bubble,\" one will find that the rest of D.C. is easily accessible and is perfect for anyone looking for an adventure.\r\n\r\nIf you've never been an active runner but wanted to get started, Georgetown's location is perfect–there are so many places to explore on foot, whether one likes to run on streets (in which case, running on M Street or going to Dupont is for you), towards monuments, or to more park-y areas (Rock Creek Park and TR Island are quite close).",

            "Review": "The campus is clustered but hilly, with stairs galore. The walk to Yates (the gym) forgoes the need for a warm-up. Many students bike, but most just walk.\r\n\r\nDon't even think about owning a car, or even renting a zipCar if you live on-campus. Parking fees are ridiculous, driving on-campus is unthinkable, and DC is much more walker-friendly than driver-friendly. If living off-campus, zipCars are easy to get but you will face the perils of DC traffic.\r\n\r\nTo get off-campus is easier than you think. On weekdays, there are 5-6 GUTS buses that shuttle between various areas of DC like Dupont Circle and the Rosslyn metro. They are free, clean, and go until late at night. Very convenient and often used when going to the basketball games.\r\n\r\nDC transportation is a bit tricky to figure out, but once you get it, you get it. Metro buses stop right outside the gate, but they require a bit of skill and research before you go use them. There is no Metro train-stop in Georgetown itself, but the walk to Rosslyn is not terrible for the moderately ambitious, and the DC Metro is very clean and easy to use. Taxis stop right outside the gates and are no different from any other taxi. All in all, however, the simplest, cheapest way of transportation is walking.",

The hangout lounges, places to study in the libraries, the different sporting events, campus parties on the rooftop, and the location of the campus is near a number of shops and food places. There are tons of organizations to join and its always something to do, even relaxing on the lawn while reading a book.",

There are other DC Circulator buses which come to the University at regular and frequent intervals if you feel like taking a straight shot into the heart of the city without worrying about transferring from the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS) bus to the metro. The DC Circulators are great for direct transport to farther destinations, and transferring between buses is fairly easy, but you have to pay per ride.\r\nAs far as taxis go, they're in abundance, but I wouldn't recommend them unless you feel like giving out a good portion of your paycheck to ride somewhere you could just take a bus or walk to.",

Georgetown does not sell parking permits so if a student wanted to have a car they would have to just park on the street wherever they can find a spot. It is very easy to walk around campus and there is absolutely no reason to have a car unless you are commuting outside of D.C. with frequency (which very few students do). I am very glad that students do not have cars at school because it would change the campus dynamic. It is always possible to run into friends when you are out at night walking around.

On my first day of class freshman year a professor had every student say \"The one thing that differentiates them from every other student that applied.\" It was incredible to hear the responses, every single student had some defining experience or characteristic that really set them apart. That uniqueness carries over through all four years. Georgetown enables students to take advantage of living in D.C. The vast majority of students either get a job or an internship in D.C. before they graduate. Finally, Georgetown is an incredibly global university.

Once you get into September/early October it drops to 80s/70s, then to the 60s for later October and November for the fall. Snowed in late October here which was weird, and sometimes it rains a lot, but the norm is about 60 for the fall. Also beautiful, even in cold weather theres usually sun. Raincoat and rainboots are a must, haven't been through winter or spring here but supposively any snow means classes are canceled and spring is beautiful. Wouldn't want to stay over the summer though, too hot.",

            "Review": "Couldn't Be Better (But Expensive !) – Its the best neighborhood in Washington DC, as well as the most expensive. There's endless shopping and dining places to experience, but beware that its not cheap. The most affordable clothing stores are H&M/express/victoria's secret, and the next up is probably Urban Outfitters. It gets worse after that with places like Nine West, Coach, Ralph Lauren, and Betsy Johnson. Still, window shopping is fun and you can always find key items at these places for your wardrobe and often there are student discounts. The cheapest restaurant places are chipotle and qudoba (considered the \"fast food\" of georgetown) but theres also places like cvs. Overall, its a great place to live but unless you're rich (most students are annyways) you'll have to budget. Haven't been out into the city much but I imagine theres a lot more options.\r\n\r\nIts worth living here because there is so much to do and see and youre in a great metropolitan area just a few minutes from the district.",

Georgetown is one of two schools in the US that has an international health major for undergrads. \"The department's curriculum blends public health and health systems management with an emphasis on the environment, culture, economics, and politics and their influence on health.\" \r\nGeorgetown is also known for it's School of Foreign Service (Bill Clinton graduated from it). It's pretty self explanatory. It's a sweet school with so many opportunities available.\r\nGeorgetown also has the largest presence of interns on Capital Hill (yes even more than Harvard). The networking opportunities are limitless and even if you are not interested in politics many national organizations have their headquarters in DC. Plus there is no other city like DC and if you're going to go to school then Georgetown is the best choice.\r\nWhile Georgetown may not have the title of an Ivy League (we have been offered multiple times but have declined because we would have to give up our Jesuit identity/philosophy and Big East status) we have the academics to compete with the top and sports teams that could easily beat out any Ivy League school.\r\nModel UN is huge here!!!! We host the largest high school conference in the nation, bringing in students from all over the nation and world. Our traveling time also consistently wins awards at multiple Model UN conferences beating out other top ranking universities. \r\n\r\nGeorgetown is seriously just the place to be.

It can get really sticky and gross in the spring/summer.  The only profound weather which incredibly affected my campus experience was the blizzard that hit the East coast.  We had 3 blizzards - each leaving the campus with a foot to 2.5 feet of snow.  School was shut down for 10 days (including weekends).

Curves can lead to grade deflation, but the overall academic experience is great. Generally, professors are experienced, easily accessible, and engaging. The location is unparalleled. DC is an amazing city and Georgetown is arguably the nicest part of town. Basketball games at the Verizon Center, homecoming, March Madness, and Georgetown Day bring out the huge amounts of school spirit and it's clear that the vast majority of the students absolutely love where they go to school. Socially, it's a different social experience than a lot of schools because greek life is non-existent, but that in no way harms how much fun students have. Georgetown is the quintessential college experience and the perfect balance of work and play.",

However, it's still a struggle. I took out loans last year and am an RA this year, which has paid for my loans. I don't know how I'm going to pay for my senior year, as my parents and I won't really be able to afford it and likely will have to take out many loans.\r\n\r\nTalk to the financial aid office, in person, as soon and as often as possible.

However, Leo's is better than the dining halls at the school I transferred from, so I can't complain too much. The worst thing is that the meal swipes don't carry over from week to week and you can't swipe in friends.\r\n\r\nEinstein's accepting meal swipes is a gift, although eventually you get very tired of the bagels and things that Einstein's offers. Leo's grab and go is bad, except for the breakfast during the week, which is really nice if you have an 8am lecture or something.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is only one location for dining halls sucks, especially when it's raining or you live far away (like in LXR or Darnall).\r\n\r\nOther campus food: Hilltoss, Vittles, and Snaxa are okay but overpriced. Corp coffee is kind of the same and the service is always very slow, although cheaper than starbucks and convenient. Epi has dollar sushi in the afternoons, but is overpriced at other times. It stays open 24 hours though, which is nice. If Hoyacourt gets meal swipes, it will be great.",

There's actually a really wide variety of things at Leo's, and if you're willing to wait in line for a while, some really good food. Leo's is a lot better than a lot of other campus cafeteria's I've visited. The most annoying thing is that other options on campus are all really expensive and for the most part don't offer meal exchange programs (use a meal swipe as payment) but that's actually changing this year- Subway, Salad Creations, and Elevation Burger should be joining Einstein Bagel in the meal exchange program.",

So there's room for improvement.

There's a LOT of options around campus, and the thing that's helpful is that most of these locations take GOCard money (the student ID card that's needed for access to dorms, meal plans, etc.).  Wisey's has fantastic sandwiches (especially the Chicken Madness), Q'doba offers half price dinner on Mondays, Chipotle gives Georgetown students a free drink with every meal, and Five Guys is open until 4 AM (!!) on weekends.  Wingo's has great chicken wings and fingers, and Kitchen No. 1 provides the quintessential Chinese food.",

There are lots of adorable restaurants, ranging from Crepe Amour to Sweetgreen (salads and fro-yo), from student favorites like Wisey's and the Tombs to fancier places like 1789.  A mealtime trip to M Street can be a really fun break from Leo's, but if you're a broke student with rich friends like me, it can be a bit exasperating, because anything interesting is not really in a poor kid's budget.",

There are a ton of basic options (pizza, pasta, stir fry, wraps, sandwiches, soups, salads, cereal, breakfast/lunch/dinner diner food) but that's as complicated as it gets. Nothing is bad but nothing is super good either, except maybe the chicken fingers on thursdays and the french fries. You're required to have a meal plan freshman year and they're expensive, I have the 10 meal plan and living in Darnall (farthest from Leo's) I usually only use up to 8 a week. You have to get creative when making a meal. Easy to steal food to bring back to your room, grab and go option is okay (WAY healthier than all you can eat buffet at Leo's) but not worth the $10ish dollars youre paying per meal. There are block plans (such as 75 meals per semester) that are only supposed to be for upperclassmen but I plan on getting one anyways. You get relatively little flex dollars ($50 with the 10 meal plan) but there are a few Corp coffee shops that these become very useful at. Theres also a Subway thats always good and Vital Vittles is an impressive on campus grocery store. The epicurean is delicious but expensive, you'll end up paying around $8-$10 for a solid meal but its worth it if you are living in Darnall. Overall, not bad just expensive. As a freshmen, just explore all the options and discover if you really will be interested in a meal plan in future years.",

Leavey has a few fast food places to eat at (Subway, Cosi, and Starbucks are normally the only one's ever open though). Epicurean is a restaurant on campus that has fairly good food but at obscene prices. In general, I recommend getting the smallest meal plan and just buying some groceries to make your own food or venture out into the city and try exotic food if you can afford it.",

            "Review": "Housing selection is a very painless experience; the university provides lots of information about the process and tries to give students as much freedom as possible while trying to be fair to everyone. Freshmen choose roommates through CHARMS and are randomly assigned to freshmen-only dorms. Sophomore and beyond, you may apply to the lottery for certain housing options that are generally better than freshman dorms. Many people group up and apply to live together. Junior and seniors can live in campus-owned townhouses - Village A, Village B, or Henle - if they want.\r\n\r\nThe housing itself? Simple, functional, brick-walled public-school 60's/70's utilitarian. Nothing has been recently renovated apart from New South. Each dorm has its own advantages (for example, Village C West has its own bathrooms, Village A has a view, Southwest Quad dorms are in the middle of everything, Darnall Hall develops super-tight floor communities, etc.). Convenience varies, but the clustered campus makes even the walk from Darnall (no man's land) manageable. You'll see rats outside at night, but rarely in a dorm. Cleanliness is essential to keep cockroaches out.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Georgetown dorms are fine. The differences in quality aren't that drastic (even if you get Darnall, you'll be fine, take it from a current resident). They are livable and work for everything you need from a dorm.  However, visiting your friends at GW may make you die a little inside.",

Rooms are a good size and there's plenty of storage space. No one will want to visit you though.\r\nVCW- by far the best if you want your own bathroom! The rooms are smaller but it's because you have your own bathroom.

It's nasty, for the most part, and people are just incredibly loud. All of my friend who live there complain about the noise and not being able to go to sleep before 2am on weekDAYS or study in their rooms.

The interesting thing about Georgetown is that you are treated like an independent adult in all interactions with the University. The same holds true for off campus housing. If you want to live off campus it is on you to search for a place. There are always tons of houses on the market with a huge price range. If you want to live in front of the University it will be very pricey but the houses are great. If you are looking for something cheaper you can live on the other side of campus in Burleith. There is a vibrant off campus life. Georgetown owns a lot of houses outside of the gates so it is hard to define 'off campus.' I rent a house with friends but I live across the street from a dorm.",

Harbin (social and you can become close with your clustermates, awkward room layouts but big), New South (newest, big rooms with awkward layout, social but not intimate), and VCW (own bathrooms but TINY rooms) are all close together and by Leo's (the only dining hall) so its kind of a \"freshman social area\" where you see/run into a lot of people. BEWARE OF DARNALL: in opposite corner of campus, 10-15 walk from Leo's, small/muggy rooms with little light, disgusting bathrooms, slow elevators, stairs up to lobby/RHO, separated from rest of freshman campus. Henle (sophomore/junior apartments) is in the same location and no one complains, but thats because your friends will be all over the place as well. It sucks being left our of the 3-dorm freshman cluster, and yeah you will become noticeably closer with your floor/dorm mates than everyone else but I dont think its worth it. And you mostly bond over the fact that your dorm sucks. If you have a horrible floor, you are forced to hang out with them. My best friends are in New South and no one ever wants to come over here, also walks on the way back down alleyways/by parking garages and the hospital are dangerous/scary and cold in the winter time. Housing is random so you don't really have a choice, but there's always the option of trying to switch out if you get Darnall (which I would definitely recommend)",

In fact, it is the most expensive part in DC, but it is not that much more expensive than living on campus (but there's no financial aid of course lol). If you have a car then you can get a decently priced apartment in another part of the city , but only if you have a car because public transportation is defintely a problem when it comes to gtown",

            "Review": "I have not yet had to deal with off-campus housing, but it is extremely inconvenient that GU does not guarantee on-campus housing your junior and senior year and that obviously because it is DC, living off-campus is pricey.  Some areas are 15 minutes away from campus but it still is unfortunate if you are like 99% of the campus and are involved in 100 activities.",

            "Review": "Cheap but Poor Quality – Housing off campus is relatively cheap for DC prices however, the conditions of the houses are usually poor.  You will have several roommates and will often deal with unfriendly landlords.  Off-campus housing is easy to find and is close to campus.",
