Strong Academics & Resources – UPenn is known for its rigorous academics, especially in business (Wharton), law, medicine, and social sciences. Students appreciate the interdisciplinary approach, allowing them to take courses across different schools.\n\n4. Extracurriculars & Student Life – With over 450 clubs, students can engage in research, entrepreneurship, community service, and cultural organizations.                                                 2. i would like see change Competitive Culture – Some students feel UPenn has a \"pre-professional\" and competitive atmosphere, particularly in business and finance.",

The professors are professional and relatable. I can relate to the fact that me and my professors have poetry and short stories published in literary journals. So there's that rare commonality.

Campus is its own space that is mostly contained around locust walk. There are a lot of trees and nature despite being so close to a big city.

In regard to academic programs, the University of Pennsylvania has world-renowned options, particularly in nursing and business (the Wharton school). One unique aspect of the University of Pennsylvania is its commitment to diverse populations and perspectives. Our freshman class this year has students from over 100 countries, bringing a variety of cultures and languages to the community at Penn. The University of Pennsylvania has a very selective admissions process but once accepted, the university is very welcoming and cares about the wellness of its students. The university has a very political atmosphere and can tend to relate narrow viewpoints related to political issues. There have also been recent protests related to political issues that brings a sense of insecurity and division to campus.",

Counciling/administration is incredibly unhelpful and makes it almost impossible to succeed, if you are not majoring in finance, entrepreneurship, econ, etc.  The atmosphere revolves around money and it is next to impossible to get anything done, as the school operates like a business--every aspect of it serves only to make it more money with complete disregard to student happiness/success (unless, as stated, said student is in Wharton or has parents willing to donate exorbitant amounts of money to the school).",

Some people get lucky with advisors, but a lot of them simply don't care, and the funding is set up in a way that pits the different schools against one another, leading to structures that serve schools rather than students. However, there are many things to Penn's credit as well. Our academics in most programs, particularly engineering, anything related to the cognitive sciences, medicine, etc, are much more rigorous than anything you find at most schools, even some other Ivies, because there's more of an emphasis on theory in lectures than larger universities, but also a, large amount of practice involved since there's so much pre-professionalism and Ben Franklin founded the school. (Not always a fan of the pre-professionalism but that's a separate thing). Point being, there is both good and bad at Penn, but I find that Penn students generally multifaceted while being more pragmatic than elsewhere.",

This approach allows for a more balanced and productive discussion that can lead to positive changes and improvements in the education system.

            "Review": "I'm so grateful to have spent four years at Penn, a school that gave me opportunities I couldn't have imagined possible before. I studied abroad in France twice. I recorded two albums with my a cappella group. I conducted research for my thesis in Los Angeles. I performed The Vagina Monologues in front of thousands of people. I published academic and creative work for journals, magazines, and one of Penn's libraries. I had unlimited access to free coffee at the most welcoming work-study job. In the same night, I pranced about on one stage as an 18th-century man and rocked out in a ball gown with a band on another stage in downtown Philadelphia. I met some of my best friends on the very first day of my freshman orientation. This was my Penn story from 2012 to 2016. The university looks a lot different for students today, especially in terms of feeling safe to practice their religion, protest peacefully, and voice concerns. I hope Penn prioritizes its students' well-being moving forward.",

Academically, UPenn is tough and I had to spend time in my first year purposefully adjusting to what was expected of me. I have learned a lot about topics I am interested in. There is a wide range of classes. Outside of class, there are some negatives at UPenn. I think the dining hall are bad. There are not enough options, and the dining halls are not open all the time, so you may not have time to go and have a meal when they are open. There are lots of clubs to join and there are always events going on, so there is always something to do. Philadelphia is a great city and it is easy to go into Center City from campus.",

I liked the comprehensiveness of the core curriculum, as well as the breadth of elective options and relative freedom to customize your degree. The professors were for the most part stellar, curriculum really well designed, and administration very supportive of students. The campus is lively and student clubs aplenty.

Although the resources are plentiful, they are not widely promoted enough to vastly reach all the students that can make use of them. It is a lot of seeking to find the resource you need. Although it is a private university with one of the largest endowments, financial aid is not sufficient as I expected. As I was struggling financially, I still had to pay a good amount of tuition. Joining a Greek organization is also expensive. Applications for clubs are immensely difficult. These things promote a gap between those who can afford and those who cannot and those who have had experiences and those who have not. Attending college is about learning and achieving more access, but this university lacks on that end. Some courses have a flip classroom learning style, which I would say is not why I'm attending college.",

This university is also ranked the #1 school for nursing, and the opportunities here are limitless. If there is a specific research you are interested in, there is likely a professor who is already researching this topic. The networking system is insane given that this university is close by CHOP and UPENN Medicine. Highly suggest going here, but the tuition is really expensive.",

As a world-renowned Ivy League school, Penn takes students from all over the globe, with a variety of racial and gender identities, backgrounds, hobbies, and academic interests. When I meet new people here, they always blow my mind.\n\nOpportunities are everywhere. Penn is a research institution with renowned researchers in just about every field imaginable, and the cool thing is, everyone can be found within one campus! This makes it possible to get involved with research of all sorts, including typically graduate-level fields like medicine, law, or dental medicine. \n\nPhiladelphia is full of discoveries. Penn is situated near Philadelphia's Center City, a city with an amazingly rich history. I especially love the culture of volunteering and philanthropy here.\n\nPenn may be hard to get in, but life here is phenomenal!",

Penn, being one of the largest universities in the world and the number one employer in the city of Philadelphia, should be engaging more in corporate social responsibility projects to offset their negative impacts to social norms in the city. Penn is one of the greatest contributors to fossil fuel investments in Philadelphia and are displacing black facilities in West Philadelphia by increasing real estate prices through land acquisition. Being an academic institution doesn’t exempt one from working towards the betterment of the community it inhabits.",

The amount of diversity you encounter is tremendous. It is the perfect blend of a campus life located in a city and the perfect example of a school with well-rounded students. Penn is also known for its research and professional resources. No matter what career you are considering Penn is the place to be. It is the school with the highest percentage of students with internships. There are numerous opportunities to get involved in research. One complaint might be that the culture is too pre-professional, but Penn has a great liberal arts program as well. It has some of the best programs in linguistics, psychology, and urban studies. Penn is a campus where innovation and research are encouraged and fulfilled. Furthermore, it is one of the best colleges in terms of engaging and serving the community.",

I explored a variety of subjects and transferred internally mid-way through my undergraduate career to focus on a business degree at Wharton, with a computer science minor. The school emphasizes pre-professionalism, providing many resources for corporate career development but also placing a lot of pressure on the student body. The student climate was compettiive, and students often spent most of their time with their extracurricular groups. The older dorms (I did not live in any of the newer developments) needed to renovations, and were unhygenic and cramped.",

However, It was not that easy. I spent a majority of my freshman year learning how to adapt to a unisex school environment on my own, a shift that took more of a toll on me more than I expected. I soon learned that I had a severe case of social anxiety and found networking and making friends to be extremely difficult. However, I found so many safe spaces on campus. Spaces where my social anxiety dissipated into thin air. Spaces where I could express my true identity without the fear of judgment. At times It was harder than others to find this comfort., especially in spaces that lacked cultural and academic diversity. I would often come across individuals who were explicitly   unaccepting of my culture and race, but I did not let these experiences deter or hider the personal introspection and growth that I want to achieve.",

The wealth gaps at Penn are striking, and as a FGLI student myself, it can be overwhelming. It's been hard to see my peers who really struggle economically to have to return to unsafe or uncomfortable home situations when our spring semester went online because of the pandemic. Penn also has a responsibility to give back to the Philadelphia community, and I don't think they've always made the most ethical decisions as an institution.

I would also like to see the growth of majors such as mechanical engineering and the addition of classes with focus on other concentrations such as aerospace design, and more. Despite these things, UPenn has fantastic people. It is easy to get involved in extracurriculars, house duties/planning events, and more. UPenn definitely feels like a home to me.",

My experience has truly exceeded my expectations both academically and socially. This is largely because I am not afraid to ask for help when I need it. One challenge that students at Penn face is that its so big that you will not be helped unless you yourself go out and ask for it. There are plenty of resources available to students who want help (ie. there are academic resources and mental health resources), but if you don't ask for them or seek them out, you won't be helped. Overall, I'm so grateful that I attend Penn and I wouldn't transfer anywhere else for the world.",

It is one of the most meaningful years of my time as a college undergraduate. I want to cite three reasons why I consider UPenn a very good university; its location and campus, its resources and extracurricular, and its prestigious academic atmosphere.\n\nUPenn is located in Philadelphia, a city with a lot to do, whether the goal is leisure and entertainment or career advancement and research for a project. But the campus itself is beautiful and busy enough to trap you. There is always something going on, especially if you commit to activities and clubs that interest you. And lastly, everything from your classmates to the professor bring alive that feeling that gives UPenn its cannon as an Ivy League; beyond academic excellence, its people are friendly, intellectually curious, driven, and serviceable, willing to share their passions and desire to grow with others.",

A lot of people feel Imposter Syndrome, and it's especially hard if you're coming from a \"hard\" school and fought for going to an Ivy League only to think that you're not smart enough. It takes a while to adjust, but I think most people keep their head above water (thanks to good friends, occasional therapists visits, and a lot of motivation).\n\nThe hardest part about Penn is its pre-professionalism, which can become tiring. There are engineers boasting about the 100k they're going to get post-graduating, Whartonites focused on how they're going to end up on Wall Street, pre-meds planning for three majors and getting lost in their coursework; it's easy to feel inadequate. Sometimes this acts as a motivator to apply for jobs or internships, but sometimes it does a blow to your self-esteem.\n\nGoing to a hard college means it's going to be hard. For me, it was worth it. Throwing yourself off the deep end is a huge change, and maybe, a good one.",

I have been challenged like never before in my time management, studying skills, and abilities to adapt to new ways of thinking. The professors present their individual subjects with a desire to create change and better that field. Socially, the environment is competitive but I have encountered many peers who are eager to collaborate and help one another succeed. The surrounding area and the city of Philadelphia encourage adventure, and even on campus there is no shortage of activities on any given day of the week because of the boundless events and clubs. Students at Penn have limitless opportunities to discover and cultivate their interests through the engaging academia and diverse, friendly community of students.",

The highly professional environment and competitive atmosphere pushes students to reach their highest potential and grow beyond it. Penn also encourages students to have balanced social lives, and provides the students with the necessary resources to have their interests be represented within campus and in student groups. However, I must admit that Penn's hyper-competitive environment  does have drawbacks, especially on students' mental health. I think Penn could tackle this by changing their grading scheme, especially for underclassmen.",

I've been visibly looked down on when I get asked and say I'm unaffiliated, even by guys trying to hit on me. Despite this, there are some business, service, and cultural frats that seem great.

Each Greek organization has its own reputation on campus and that feeds into the feeling of being superior or inferior to others around campus. The parties are usually good, and as a non-Greek you can get in as long as you know someone and have a high girl:guy ratio.",

School is already a pretty small campus, so the Greek community is relatively tight-knit with each other. Although one does not have to be a part of Greek life to have fun, one would be able to have more relationships and opportunities to meet more people.",

The staff is diverse too and there are open groups discussing LGBT, religion and race. I have met people from diverse economic background so I would really rate Penn highly on such integration. \r\n\r\nAcceptance is very high. Am actually a member of a christian prayer group but most people are from different religions and they go to different churches on Sunday - and that's acceptable. \r\n\r\nThere is open talk about current political situations... and people are very honest about their opinions (It's not ''weird'' talking about politics - Even though I haven't seen die-hard political groups promoting their agendas",

A lot of people you meet will be in a sorority or a frat and you can still go to events through knowing them, but you honestly just choose whether or not that lifestyle fits most comfortably with you. Housing is usually run-down (at least perceived as this) from the outside and for the ones off campus. Some on-campus ones are really nice on Locust Walk but other than that the houses aren't great looking.",

As a student, your classmates and friends will be of all races, ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations. They'll open up your mind and you'll have a greater understanding of the differing peoples of the world. Penn is very welcoming regardless of however you identify yourself--you'll find small cultural communities to belong to and larger ones too. Many students might be first generation Americans, and many are international students. Some international students are the first ones from their country to ever come to Penn. Diversity is a very positive thing on campus, and people really respect others who come from unique backgrounds. No one will ever feel like an outsider at Penn-- if for some reason you do, chances are there are others who feel the same, and you can form your own activist group to change that. The student body is always mobilizing to make changes.",

Guys, in general, wear normal clothing such as jeans and a t shirt or shorts and a tee or even just their work out clothes. However, when its time to look formal, they do a good job of cleaning up with nice suits, blazers, or even vests.",

The medical amnesty policy on campus says that when someone calls for medical attention for a friend who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, neither the friend nor the sick person can get in trouble for consumption. This is a great policy, in my opinion, because it allows people to feel free to get medical help when they need it, but not worry about getting into trouble.",

There are plenty who won't raise their heads from their Wharton books, but there are tons of really cool ones, too.\r\n\r\n3)  People always give Wharton kids a bad rep.  Sure, there are some that just want to build huge capitalistic business empires, but there are some really awesome ones, too.\r\n\r\n4)  Personally, I find engineering kids to be less friendly than Wharton kids.

            "Review": "Great Parties, Great Standard of Living – Greeks make their presence known to freshmen during NSO through their parties.  From that point onwards, many of the finest men and women have their hearts set on rushing.  These parties are essentially the core of the Penn nightlife, and most parties are pretty decent or better.\r\n\r\nA factor though, is that for men, frequently a ratio is enforced, generally a 2 girls : 1 guy ratio.  So it really helps to have a lot of girl friends when you do go out.\r\n\r\nGreek Housing on the other hand, is a major part of campus life, but it varies wildly in quality from one frat to another.  Some of the frats are housed in notable buildings on campus, while others are housed \"on-campus\" but a few blocks away from the center.  Again, most frats have pretty decent houses, but some have phenomenal ones.",

I continue to be amazed at the professors that Penn has, and have yet to dislike any of the teachers who I have had the pleasure of being in their classes. The opportunities for extracurricular activities are extensive and no areas of interest seem to go unnoticed. Penn is also very involved with the surrounding West Philadelphia community and has many ways to become involved in community outreach. In this sense, Penn is a great school to attend for a well-rounded college experience because a prestigious education is combined with a versatile social life, community interaction, and city living.",

Whatever the metric is, Penn scores highly when it comes to academics.  The workload is stressful and professors tend to really like the students that get excited about what they teach (they see teaching Penn kids as a privilege).  There are many professors that focus on doing research, but that's just another opportunity!  Most are happy to take undergraduate research assistants.  Go win that Nobel Prize!",

A deeply historic city with a deep tradition in arts and a burgeoning modern living movement, there's always something for everyone, should students bother to venture off campus (which also happens to have tons going on).",

The gym is free even if you're not an athlete, the digital media center is helpful even if you're not studying anything related to computers, and most buildings can be opened after hours regardless of affiliation as long as you have an ID.",

However, make sure to never miss a Simply Chaos stand up comedy show, an Excellano Project spoken word performance or a Glee music show. \r\n\r\nAthletic events really aren't central to campus, though.",

Study spaces are innumerable, and options range from a cozy couch in Houston Hall to a silent cubicle in the library to one of many grassy areas outdoors. The student center, Houston, is a good meet-up spot for studying or food and also hosts many events. The athletic centers, while not modern (see the Palestra and Franklin Field) reap their beauty from their history. The Palestra is a museum of basketball- absolutely amazing.",

Parking garages (There are four on or near campus) is pricier. A student should not need a car on campus, for everything is so close. Even Center City or other parts of Philly is easily accessible on foot or through public transportation. A car would be a hassle!",

On the upside, this means you are guaranteed a spot no matter what--downside is that it can cost up to 2400, depending on whether or not you plan plan on getting annual, school year, commuter, etc parking. Ticketing is pretty harsh, so I wouldn't suggest parking on the street unless you know that you will be there for less than 2hrs. Meter maids will literally be waiting by your car and watching the second to give you a ticket. On the flip side you absolutely DON'T need a car for campus unless you plan on commuting to/from campus.

Snow isn't ever really a problem, the school and city do a pretty good job of keeping roads clear.

Avoid using public facilities if possible during exam periods. A better alternative is a reasonably-sized laptop or netbook which can link to the wi-fi printing. Try to find free places to print such as the LGBT center because printing at any school is expensive. I print at my work-study job. However, if you are turning in the printed item, print at Wharton because the paper is more professional. \r\n\r\nNursing does not require too much printing so you don't necessarily need to be in the computer lab too often. Also, computer intensive classes usually have computers in the room or teachers allow laptops so not much of an access problem here.\r\n\r\nI can't speak to the labs in the other schools but of the campus libraries (about 12), have computers that anyone can access. \r\n\r\nFor all schools, printing/copying can be done with Penn Cash. The bonus in Wharton is that you automatically get a $20 credit per semester from Wharton for Wharton printing. So use it (if applicable) before using Penn Cash.",

But it is... between Center City's fun nightlife, parks, and eclectic restaurants/shopping; the beautiful history in Old City, and the charming neighborhoods in South Philly (not gonna lie, North Philly scares me)... this city has been perfect for me. The reason I pin it as the perfect city is that for cheap I can travel by bus to New York or DC and be there within 2 or 3 hours, respectively (with the train, even less time).

There is also a pool and a basketball court. After working out, they have a nice cafe where you can buy refreshments like smoothies to cool off.\r\n\r\nPenn also has a lot of libraries that are great to study at. Fisher Fine Arts Library is very quiet and a great place to do some hard core studying. Van Pelt is another major library many kids go to. There is a cafe in the ground floor that's open until 2 AM for students that will be studying all night. There are 6 floors of resources - music library, digital media lab, etc.\r\n\r\nArt galleries like Fisher Fine Arts Gallery and the Institute of Contemporary Art are great ways to keep in touch with the art scene in Philadelphia.",

The pre-professional feel is very dominant and seems to detract from the normal feel of undergraduate life.

There are chains as well as restaurants, although most of the restaurants are a bit pricy and are really only options when parents come to visit, for most students. There are occasionally promotions and discounts for students but only at the more commercial eateries like QDoba. There is a good range of kinds of foods from burgers to Mexican to Asian cuisines and steak houses, organic restaurants and seafood. Still, for a student on a budget who already has to afford the University's outrageous costs, it's hard to take advantage of the options due to cost. Even the most convenient supermarket is much more expensive than the quality of its products merits, although it's still more affordable to shop there and make your own food than constantly get take-out or eat out like many of the students do.",

Houston Market and the cafes that take dining dollars are good though. You're better off just using dining dollars than getting a full meal plan.",

Houston Hall has good options that are made in front of you, but places like Hill dining hall seem to have similar food night after night. Hill used to have a pasta toss option, where you could pick what you wanted to be put into a bowl with pasta, but a few months after the start of the year, they switched to just offering one type of pasta with veggies or meat in it. It's not bad, but I miss the variety!",

McClelland express is pretty good, but it can get really slowed down at crowded times.  Hill is a cosistently good option at well, but at lunch it is a mad-house.  King's Court is worth it if you have the time to get there because it offers great food and is seldom crowded. \r\n\r\nMost dining dollars options are much, much better than the meal plans, especially the Bistro in Houston.",

Miss Anita at the front is really sweet, but unfortunately I can't eat her for dinner, making the venture quite worthless. Hillel is good for the extra $2, and Kings Court is small and thus rather underrated. Hill is the best dining hall overall (though not saying much), and Hill Brunch cannot be missed. I do actually get excited for the chocolate chip pancakes. Thankfully, there are Dining Dollars to use at Houston Hall, ABP, and Subway, for reasonable prices.

            "Review": "Currently, I live in Hill which is known as the worst possible dorm on campus.  However, if it weren't for this dormitory I would never have met so many incredible people.  It is a hub for freshman and it is definitely one of the best  places to meet people.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have A/C so it is a rough couple of weeks in the beginning of the school year.  The quad is also a great option for freshman.  The high-rises are the most desired place on campus but hardly any freshman get in there so I wouldn't recommend applying there (as a freshman).  Plus the high-rises don't offer a great social environment for freshman trying to meet people.",

            "Review": "The quad offers freshman a wonderful college experience, as well as a beautiful little bubble enclosed from the hustle and bustle of the city. I cannot speak for Hill myself, but I have friends who say it is not as bad as some say. The building is hideous to look at from the outside, let's be honest, but the dining hall is convenient and the students living there establish very close-knit relationships. After freshman year, most on-campus housing is apartment style in the three high rises which tower over campus. I have also heard good things overall about the high rises, although a lot of students choose to live off campus or in greek establishments. I hear there are plans for a fourth high rise sometime in the future, since Penn cannot provide all students on-campus housing.",

            "Review": "As a resident of the Quad and a member of the Integrated Studies residential program, my experience with Penn Housing has been fantastic. Riepe College House, like nearly every other college house, is open to students from all years. Faculty residents add to the experience with weekly or bi-weekly events such as cookie nights, comfort-food nights, and espresso hours. Additionally, there are many house trips from a visit to Philly Orchestra to a day trip to NYC. The buildings themselves are beautiful, although most of the rooms are tiny. Most dorms have air conditioning and sinks in the rooms and the high-rises have personal bathrooms and common rooms. Campus Housing is a community experience at Penn, which is what makes it so great!",

As for grading the off-campus housing, I wish I could assign three different grades to off-campus housing.  An A+ would go to the Radian (a private apartment building but is really just another Penn dorm).  Rooms have quality kitchens, living rooms, etc. though it is reflected in the price.  Almost all the other off-campus houses are owned by Campus Apartments and its one competitor.  A B+ or A- would go to the more newly renovated buildings but there aren't many.  A C+ would go to the rest of the available housing.  And a quick shout out to on campus housing:  once you are pasted freshman year, the High Rises are quite nice, at least a B+.",

If you want to live in a fancy high rise apartment Penn has it. If you want to live in a nice big house with friends Penn has it. The only difference is that it can cost you. The houses are often much much cheaper and very reasonable while the high rises can be quite expensive.",
