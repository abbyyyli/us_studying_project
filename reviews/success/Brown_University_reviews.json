            "Review": "Brown offers a fantastic college experience, particularly in its fostering of connection within the community. Even the most timid students coming in find a group of friends, and it's incredible to see such support and collaboration on campus! The academic courses are challenging but the Open Curriculum encourages students to pursue their passions rather than a common core, and the professors are extremely accommodating and enthusiastic about what they teach!\n\nBrown's most significant area of improvement is its housing. Likely due to budget overspending, there are sometimes instances where housing conditions are subpar (forced triples, repeatedly broken heating and elevators). However, speaking from experience, these instances are rare and do not significantly impact the housing experience.",

            "Review": "Brown University is a beautiful campus. I came into it without much experience with PWI's, so that heavily influenced the way in which I experienced my first 2 years on campus. I also started college during peak COVID (2020), so it was a completely different experience than one might have imagined. With that being said, if I had a chance to re-do my undergrad, I would still make the choice of attending Brown University. I have developed and grown into someone I dreamed about during childhood, and that was thanks to my experiences (both good and bad) at Brown. A lot of work needs to be done in terms of equity and inclusion, but I will say that Brown is one of the more liberating and accepting universities that I have stepped foot on.",

The open curriculum and the ability to pass/fail any class allowed me to take truly bizarre classes, like TV and Sex, which would have otherwise been outside of my wheelhouse and far too intimidating. I have made friends in every class I have been in; people are very welcoming.\n\nThe party scene, however, is almost nonexistent. There are scattered house parties or a few clubs you can uber to, but most events are a group of friends and a bottle of wine or two. The housing is also a point of contention for undergraduates: the lack of AC, the slow response of facilities, and the lack of accessibility have made it difficult to be disabled and live on campus.",

Similar to my high school, Brown is super diverse both socially, racially, and economically. There are all types of people here from all types of backgrounds and it is truly an empowering experience to spend every day with such different people. My roommate freshman year was from south Africa, was indian, but went to high school in the UK. We often would talk about cultural differences and how our lives were so different but we still ended up in the same school. I continue to have those types of interactions with my peers here at Brown and it really is altering the way that I see the world.",

Two weeks before the start of the summer break, I received an email saying that this year they had extremely limited funding for it, and I would not get it despite having the highest demonstrated financial need.

The bio department only has a handful of classes with labs, which are a required component of med school applications and force students to take classes they're not interested in. The chemistry department only offers 3 of the 4 major required chemistry classes once per year, so if you don't come in with AP credit, you're forced to either take a gap year or study for the MCAT while taking biochem. Premed advising sucks (though I'm not sure how this is changing since the old advisor left), and they delayed most students' committee letters by WEEKS during my application cycle- which, since everything is rolling, is incredibly harmful to applicants' success. The school bends over backwards to arrange shadowing for PLMEs while they're in undergrad, but doesn't offer basic assistance to regular undergraduate premeds (who arguably need it more, since almost all med schools require shadowing to get in). Grade inflation is nice though.",

Overall, the academic resources and opportunities to explore STEM-based passions are incredibly diverse and accessible. The campus has amazing faculty that are engaged in the subject, both in and out of the classroom. They provide insightful feedback and support, especially as I had little experience doing lab work in high school. \n\nOutside the classroom, there were countless facilities and events that covered a wide variety of interests. These helped me foster a strong sense of community as I was able to connect with peers of similar likes during these events. I love how interconnected the university is with the larger city of Providence, which makes both professional and recreational engagement more accessible. \n\nLastly, the Brown community was incredibly welcoming and supportive. Everyone there was proactive and engaged!",

I had a number of professors that genuinely cared about my well-being, especially during the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe accessibility on campus can be pretty rough. There are quite a few buildings that are harder to get into than necessary if you're physically disabled. For an open-minded university, you'd like to think more effort would be put into making all buildings universally accessible.\n\nIf I could choose again, I would still go to Brown.

I have discovered so many interests I never know I had! The open curriculum, in general, is perfect for students who have lots of wide-ranging interests and want to pursue multiple fields, or know exactly what they want to specialize in. But it's also great for students who have no idea, and want time to explore and try new areas of study while they figure things out. I agree with other reviewers that the food and dorms aren't outstanding by any means. However, the academic environement, professors, and fellow students at Brown are more than worth it.

I do wish the administration was a little more organized and coordinated better with all the different organization and groups on campus, but maybe COVID has made this more difficult. Everyone I've met so far is very open and collaborated and I don't feel the competitive culture I felt in high school at all.",

That being said, Brown may not do the best job of helping individual students out. Additionally, you will likely feel like an outsider if you are low income student from an urban area like myself. Overall, I’ve loved going to Brown and I know that the issues I have with the school are only worse at other schools, and for the most part, Brown tries to do its best to adapt to feedback.",

You can definitely surround yourself with the kind of people you want to be like. If you want to surround yourself with fun people who like to party, you will definitely find them. If you want to surround yourself with people who will encourage you to update your resume and go to class, you will find them. The thing is, at Brown, usually they’re both. Work hard play hard is definitely a thing here. Brown’s education is also entirely what you make it.

Beyond my classes, I have been participated in many great extracurriculars, from the orchestra to the swing club to the community engagement opportunities through the Swearer Center. What I love most about Brown, though, is the atmosphere of learning in a supportive, collaborative environment. No student is out to get anyone else. That doesn't mean we slack off; instead, it means that people are kind and ready first of all to look after each other. The reason we keep academic standards so high isn't because we compete with one another, but instead because we each have a remarkable drive to learn and really exceptional abilities to do so. This collaborative environment is a testament to the success of the Open Curriculum, as fostered by the faculty, administration, and students -- and staff, of course -- all working together.",

The open curriculum allows for lots of exploration and risk-taking in the classroom, and this culture bleeds into student life as well. The environment here is very relaxed and collaborative, and the students here are kind, accepting, and fun. And coming from a SoCal kid, the weather isn't even that bad! I've only been at Brown for one year, but I'm so glad I made the choice to come here when I was deciding between colleges last April.",

I love the open curriculum and although the workload can be heavy at times, there is a lot of grade inflation and it is easy to get A's. There are only a few downsides to going here. Although the campus is gorgeous and the brick buildings give it that classic Ivy-League feel, but that comes at a cost- a lot of the amenities are outdated. Also, even though we have an amazing, intelligent, liberal student body, many (if not most) of the students seem to be very sheltered and immature, which is nothing out of the ordinary at an Ivy. However, with a reputation as the \"different\" Ivy, students at Brown are slightly less hoity-toity compared to the typical Ivy-Leaguer. As long as you're friendly to everyone and try keep an open mind, you're golden.",

However, with the amount of time you have with each professor (this also depends on the size of the class) it's unlikely for you to become very friendly with any teachers throughout college unless you take initiative.\r\n\r\nClasses can range from 7 people to 200. There are a variety of options, usually intro classes are big while seminars, language classes, and specific topic classes are smaller. With large classes there is an immense amount of TAs that are always available to help. They also run review/discussion sections to allow students to ask specific questions and get advice from experts who already aced the class. \r\n\r\nMost classes, in the humanities, make you do a lot of reading, have a smaller discussion section, and then 2-4 big assignments like midterms, finals, essays, take home exams, etc. \r\n\r\nThe variety of courses speaks for itself. There are too many choices and they are all interesting!",

Even if one wants to go to a party, there are plenty that aren't thrown by one of the Greek houses.\r\n\r\nGreek housing is all concentrated in one quad, Wriston Quad, and I've been inside one of the houses.

I don't know as many girls who put on pounds at Brown compared to schools at home, so that definitely enhances attractiveness. Only complaint is again that there are so many more gay boys than girls, so dating is extremely competitive for girls. It is good for the straight guys (esp straight athletes/frat guys who are attractive), because there will always be a line of too many ladies, but definitely not optimal for us girls!",

Getting them to respond to anyone's needs is an uphill battle, and they definitely are more liberal than the average Brown student- which means that if you have the slightest depression they can send you away for a year, if you're accused of sexual assault you're presumed guilty and punished, or if you want your place advertised as a summer sublet there's a good chance they will simply forget to advertise it and be unresponsive when you complain about it. All of those things have happened to people I know. Apparently Brown forgot to fill out a key question on US News college survey, resulting in very low rankings this year from that missed question. It doesn't surprise me that Brown would forget something like that, even though it's important to outside people. \r\n\r\nMost of the administration would have been great if Brown were the hippie-liberal-brainwashed school it was 15 years ago, but the students are now smart and sophisticated- which means that there's a lot of tension/hatred for deans and administrators. Although President Paxson is better at managing these things than Ruth Simmons was.",

Also, with the current situation of many frats, they can't throw official parties without some reprimanding from the school.",

Brown on 4/20 is a sight to behold, and DPS stands by so that the Providence police don't show up. That said, they DO do things. I lost my phone a while ago and they helped me out a bunch, and everything I've heard is consistent with that. Basically, they're on your side unless you're being totally belligerent.",

I have nothing against that, but it makes it really hard for straight women to find a mate. Luckily I have a boyfriend, but my friends' first question when they see a cute guy isn't \"is he single?\" but \"is he straight?\" That's the reason I give Brown a B+ rather than an A or A-.

Brown has such a large and visible LGBT population, for instance, that it is nearly taken for granted that anyone could be LGBT--thus it is a very easy place to come out, relative to many other places. When it comes to socioeconomic diversity, on the other hand, the campus feels wealthy. Issues of class may make those from less privileged backgrounds feel uncomfortable. The renewed focus on financial aid after the economic crisis, however, is aiming to address this area.

On weekends, most of the parties are at the frat houses on Wriston Quad, and there is plenty of visible underage drinking, but you are unlikely to get in trouble for this.\r\n\r\nThe campus is also not strict about pot at all. However, if you do this outside, then you are more likely to get caught. Most people just smoke in their rooms, and the chances of getting caught for this are practically zero.\r\n\r\nAlso, unlike many other schools, the RA's here do not write up students or take away alcohol. They are there to give students advice and help students make good decisions. Overall, the school seems to be more interested in helping students make the right decisions rather than getting students in trouble.",

            "Review": "Brown really does live up to its prestigious name when it comes to education. Answering this after completing one semester of college, I can truly say that I have learned an unbelievable amount since arriving here. Its science department is amazing. Its math department is amazing. (As an engineering major I cannot speak for other areas of concentration). The only criticism I have is for its engineering department. Its intro course is new and still undergoing some renovation issues, but higher level courses have a reputation for being amazing. If you are planning to be an engineer and can stand the first year, then the curriculum will be great.\r\n\r\nIn terms of choosing courses, we get a \"shopping period.\" We can \"sample\" as many classes as we want during this period (usually the first two weeks into a semester) to get a feel for the class. After this period you can officially register for the course. This gives students the opportunity to really explore classes and to get to know them before deciding on whether or not to take the course.\r\n\r\nBrown's open curriculum also gives you chances students at other schools do not receive. Aside from taking required courses towards your major and fulfilling a not-very-intense writing requirement, you can take literally any class you want to take and qualify for. This allows you really shape a college curriculum that you will love. This allows you to explore areas that you did not know you liked. Heck, it might even shape the major you eventually choose! All in all, Brown has an outstanding curriculum.",

There are no general education requirements (just requirements within your major, and even then, you usually have a list of possible options that fulfill a requirement, as opposed to a single specific class).  This allows students to take what they are interested in taking.  Although there are a few majors, like engineering and computer science, that have a lot of in-major requirements, majors like these are few and far between.  Normally, Comparative Literature students are free to take Blues, Macroeconomics, and Religious and Secular Approaches to Globalization (in the Judaic Studies Department) in a single year if they chose.

The streets are somewhat narrow and the spaces available on the street are being made into permit parking only, at least during certain hours. The process to acquire parking is difficult and elusive as it is not highly advertised to those who may be interested. On the other hand, there is not much need for a car on campus because of the close proximity of dorms to classes and stores. Ticketing and fines are average and the parking enforcement is very diligent which can be both a good and bad thing depending on your view.",

There are several computer labs around campus, most of which offer both Macs and PCs as well as scanners for student use.  All of them offer printing services; the neat thing is that all Brown students receive $30 in printing money for the school year, so you're well of for a while.  However, there are some cons.  Brown offers two wireless networks, Brown_EZ and Brown-Secure, both of which are extremely unreliable and relatively slow when compared to the networks at other schools.  Furthermore, during finals period, overcrowding at the computer labs makes getting a computer very difficult and getting something printed almost impossible.  I suggest that students purchase a personal computer and a printer, since they could be your only option during crunch time.",

The public transit system, RIPTA is fairly reliable, but its routes are limited and they shut down early into the night. You're pretty much stuck on College Hill. Besides, there's never really that much going on in Providence besides Water Fire and whatever shows are playing at the Dunkin Donuts Center.",

The diversity of Providence's residents and community issues make it a great place to enjoy, learn from, and affect. I highly recommend participating in the UCAAP pre-orientation program if you are interested in getting involved in community work as a freshman (you also get aligned with great advisors through this program). As far as musical entertainment goes Providence is okay. The venues are quality and the acts that come through are relatively diverse, however, Boston is not too far away and, as a bigger city, has a greater selection of things to do.",

Winter was a bit hard for me (coming from Texas) because THERE'S SO MUCH SNOW. But I got used to it. Just make sure you buy a good winter coat and nice boots and little accessories like scarves, gloves, hats, etc. and you'll be fine. Spring is gorgeous too. Everyone will be outdoors laying on the grass and taking advantage of the weather during springtime. And summer is HOT (but not quite as hot as Texas) and VERY humid (a lot more so than I'm used to). Oh yea, and it rains A LOT in Providence (regardless of the season). Like literally on average about 3 days a week. So invest in rainboots and a good raincoat and umbrella. Other than that, you'll be fine. I LOVE PROVIDENCE WEATHER!",

I made an appeal, which wasn't very difficult to do, just kind of a hassle. The people in the financial aid office were very friendly and helpful. I ended up getting about 50% more aid. It still is not very much, but that's just the way it is. My family is middle class, and we can hardly afford to pay for Brown without making huge sacrifices. It is difficult to get aid as a middle class student.",

Like most Ivys, scholarships and financial aid are need based: they will give you enough money so that tuition is not a burden on your family. I come from a middle class family and have a twin going to Brown, and Brown accounted for all of this. They gave my family a sufficient amount of money and they made access to loans and scholarships very easy.",

This is especially helpful for lower-class students who don't receive any help from their parents, who may only have to pay a few thousand dollars a year. However, middle class families often find financial aid a little lacking.",

I've heard from some students that they didn't receive as much as they needed, but I received the perfect amount. Without my aid, I wouldn't be able to attend Brown. The process was pretty standard, since it was all need-based and I didn't have to specifically apply for any aid. I did, however, appeal my aid when I was given a better need-based offer from another school. This process was slightly annoying, but was overall fine and worked out well for me.",

Brown is determined to bring the best and brightest, most diligent and committed students to their campus, and are both able and willing to pay the bill.

However, the menus at these places don't vary much and can become boring. The most variety on campus exists at the V-Dub (Verney-Wooley Dining Hall), where one can find a little bit of everything each day. Sometimes the Ratty (Sharpe Refactory) surprises you and throws an amazing themed night with great food cooked by visiting chefs. For snacks and quick to-go meals, there are several food carts on campus as well as the famous Blue Room, which has delicious cinnamon rolls and muffins. When it's midnight and you're craving food, Jo's is the place to go; they specialize in salads, burgers and Brown's very own spicy chicken sandwiches. All in all, the food is average to amazing. The pickier an eater you are, the more quickly you'll get bored with the options, though. Still, Thayer Street has some decently priced food places (Mama Kim's Korean BBQ food truck, East Side Pockets) and many restaurants deliver to dorms (Shanghai for Chinese, Sicilia's for pizza).",

At the V-dub variety lacks but it's because the size of the dining hall is smaller. However, quality is excellent. It sucks that they close weekends though because people who live nearby it like me have to walk further to eat on weekends. But even then it's relatively close. Josiah's is a great place to have dinner and late night snacks if you plan to stay up late studying. There are more places and overall they're all great.",

The main place students get food from out is definitely Thayer St. because it's close and relatively inexpensive (about $7-10 a meal, depending on where you go).  Recently, students have been super excited about the food trucks that have started to park on Thayer, which offer a variety of foods from Korean (Mama Kims) to French (Plouf Plouf) to American (Rocket Truck and the Grilled Cheeze truck).  If one feels adventurous, there's always Federal Hill for fantastic (yet expensive) Italian food, and famous Olneyville hot-weiners (and amazing grilled cheese for vegetarians).",

After the first year of trying all the options, the two main dining halls, \"The Ratty\" and \"The V-Dub\" get a little old. The salad bar in the Ratty is always great though, and the self-serve waffle irons at the V-Dub are fun.

For Freshmen, Andrews is very new and clean and has many amenities (such as study centers and food!!) but is far from main campus. Em/Wool and Mo/Champ are pretty ugly but rooms are spacious and communities within the halls form easily. They are also far from main campus. Keeney is on the other side of campus, but still closer to main campus than the ones above. Keeney is also new and clean and has many amenities and social spaces. The environment creates its own social scene, Keeney can be a society, a huge one, in itself. However, it feels closed off from the rest of campus. Wayland is close to Keeney but on Wriston Quad with all the Greek and Program housing. It is a beautiful location, the closest to the Ratty and main campus. Its amenities are average and the rooms are average. Wayland is by far the smallest of the Freshmen communities, which has its perks and downfalls. The housing lottery after freshmen year is scary but in the end no big deal. Some Sophomore housing is right on main campus, there are opportunities for the students to live in suites a little farther from main campus and opportunities to join Greek and Program housing on Wriston. Upperclassmen can apply to live off campus, which is done regularly- there is a lot of good real estate around campus.",

I take that back: housing in general is pretty polarizing (see: Perkins vs 315 Thayer). It gets better with seniority but compared to other schools is mediocre at best. The Reslife staff could use some revamping as well. The manner with which they treat their students is god-awful.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, the administration seems to be taking some notice with renovations and, as of this year, eliminating suite fees for many of the on-campus rooms (which were pretty damned ridiculous to begin with).",

Black mold, concrete, barred windows, and rooms that haven't been properly cleaned since the 80s don't even begin to describe! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is the largest dorm on campus, so many unlucky folks are stuck there for 2 or even 3 years. \r\n\r\n3. Don't bank on getting a single as a junior…my lottery group was one away from having to be in doubles.\r\n\r\n4. This would not be horrible if we were given the option to live off campus starting in say our sophomore year- but off campus is only really guaranteed to seniors. juniors can apply to live off campus, but most are not granted off campus permission, so you need to bank on living in forms for 3 years. \r\n\r\nIf you care about the cleanliness or condition of dorm rooms, I would not go to Brown. Living conditions are a very important part of your experience (that I underestimated), and the lottery/no off-campus till senior year combo give you very limited (and often bad) options.",

Otherwise, you're pretty much stuck in dorms through your junior year which is horrible news because the housing lottery is awful, and some of the dorms have conditions that are probably questionably legal at best (i.e. toxic mold in grad center is everywhere). I actually disliked the housing situation/the fact that Brown essentially gives you no choice other than living in these h*llholes to the point where I wish I had gone somewhere else. They need to either totally revamp the dorms OR allow anyone who wants to to live off-campus.

I've stayed in dorms that are particularly nice and one that was pretty bad with large patches of peeling paint and unclean floors when moving in. Amenities are nice as there are usually kitchens and lounges in all of the dorms. Of course, some of these spaces are better than others. The social atmosphere is better in some dorms than others depending primarily on the layout and the type of students. For instance, freshman are generally more outgoing in making friends while upperclassmen are more set in their social circles. The cost of the housing is like paying for an actual apartment but the time spent in these dorms is invaluable, much like the college experience as a whole. The social atmosphere is also aided by the proximity of campus to Thayer Street which features many popular shops and restaurants. The housing process is interesting and often frustrating as there is a housing lottery where numbers are issued based on seniority. The process itself can be hard but if you follow the guidelines, you should be able to find something that you like.",

They aren't the biggest or best, but it has a sense of camaraderie that is really great. Upperclassmen dorms are spacious and nice because you can choose to live with your friends and you have a lot of different options and rooms.",

You'll be enjoying life here so much that you'll hardly spend time in your dorm anyway. (If you do, you know you're at the wrong place.) That said, the dorms are spacious and have everything you need. The newer dorms, of course, are the nicest and most coveted. Also, most people live on campus all 4 years, which helps add a sense of community. This is not a commuter school.",

There is a big range in quality and price-- you just don't want to be paying more for lower quality (which sometimes seems to be the case).",

Parking on and around the Brown University campus is a NIGHTMARE, so most students do not bring cars to school.   So, you tend to see students opt for housing that immediately surrounds the campus so they can still walk or ride bikes to class, etc    Of course, the demand on housing surrounding the campus tends to bring rental costs up, so it is not uncommon to have multiple students sharing a place.",

Everyone definitely has a shot at a good dorm building not just upperclassmen. Housing Lottery is hectic and chaotic so a new system should be put in place so that students are less stressed out about the process. Locations are even except fr Perkins and Young Orchard which are both far from everything on campus.",
