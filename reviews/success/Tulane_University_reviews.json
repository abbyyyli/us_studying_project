            "Review": "I’m a Tulane alum and current parent.  As someone with deep Louisiana and New Orleans roots I am appalled by the attitudes of Tulane students and their parents towards New Orleans.  Most treat it like an amusement park where they can eat beignets and watch Mardi Gras parades without any appreciation or respect for the rich history and traditions of the area.  FYI, Mardi Gras is based in Catholicism.  Tulane needs to do a better job of educating New Orleanians and Louisianans who have an interest in staying in the community and advocating for local issues instead of giving Northeast kids a four-year fun-trip down south.  Their parents are just as bad.  They do nothing but appropriate the culture and then leave.",

One of the aspects I’ve appreciated the most is the diverse campus life. The opportunity to interact with people from various backgrounds has been enriching. Academically, Tulane has offered me a challenging yet rewarding environment, particularly within my field of study: Cell & Molecular Biology. The strong networking opportunities at Tulane have also been a significant advantage. I believe there could be more resources for community engagement. While Tulane is already deeply connected to New Orleans, further fostering partnerships with local organizations and creating more opportunities for students to engage with the city would enrich the college experience even more.",

I had some not so great professors for the hard sciences, and one class was fully taught by a graduate student that did not have enough experience. The food at Tulane during my time was BAD but I've heard it has improved. I would recommend Tulane to all my friends as it completely shaped who I am today.",

They do not care about their student body at all and make everything ten times harder and more complicated than it needs to be. Speaking of student body, there is zero diversity, everyone is either from California, Chicago, or New York, not to mention rude, snobby , and narcissistic. The going out scene is nothing other than trashy. Blacking out every night of the week, drugs, etc. (well aware that is part of college but a whole new level here). Housing is disgusting. Freshman dorms are the worst. Every type of mold, bodily fluids, and only cleaned properly once or twice a year, not to mention haven’t been renovated at all in over 20 years. Mail pickup is ridiculous, class registration is even more ridiculous (no words can describe how horrible it is). New Orleans is “fun” but extremely dangerous. Only pro is food and garden district is great. People praise this school for literally nothing, it sucks.",

There are full departments (math, chemistry, etc.) that are so bad that you are advised to take online courses over the summer instead. Not only that, but class registration is impossible. I am paying 45k per semester to take few to no credits that go toward my major. Basically, taking random classes because there are not enough classes or professors for the lower level classes to accommodate everyone who needs to take them.",

The classes I have taken are challenging and engaging, pushing me to grow both intellectually and personally. The vibrant and unique campus life has provided me with unforgettable experiences and lifelong friendships. I am very grateful for my experience so far, and would like to continue my education at Tulane; however, the high cost of attendance has been a significant source of stress, as it’s challenging to manage financially without sufficient aid. Despite this, I can't imagine being anywhere else, and I hope Tulane can find ways to make education more accessible for all students. It would also be a nice change if Tulane improved resources to help students find real scholarships that make a difference.",

At first, I had no idea what studying at Tulane would be like since I haven’t met any single soul at Tulane in person, which is why I was so nervous about going to New Orleans. But when I had the opportunity to gather and talk with current students at Tulane, my viewpoint completely changed. Everyone there was so welcoming, genuine and humorous. It was different from everywhere I have been to because I felt warm-hearted by Tulanies’ sympathy and hospitality towards new students like me. Dr. Love was so welcoming and gave me a handful of advice to help me prepare a lot for my journey in the future. Just by meeting people at Tulane, I can see myself adapting and growing in the future at such a great and diverse community where there are a plenty of programs for international students. I firmly believe that Tulane is such an amazing society.",

The campus is beautiful, the students are happy, and the weather is perfect, minus the rain. The academics are rigorous but manageable, leaving time to get involved in extracurriculars, explore New Orleans, or anything else you want to do. New Orleans is an amazing and fun city with so much to see! The class sizes, at least for me personally, have been so small, and the relationships I have built with my professors are so special. The social climate can be a bit tough to manage for introverts or for those who do not enjoy going out often, but once you find your niche it is a non-issue. The academics are super flexible, and I'm able to graduate early despite choosing to study abroad! The culture and the people here are truly special, and I urge anyone interested in Tulane to consider checking it out and applying!",

Tulane is really flexible with what you can major and minor in, which is nice, but if you want to major or minor in something a little more uncommon, they probably don't have it. Their language selection is incredibly small, as well. While the professors are super interested in helping students succeed, they are the only people, really. I'm convinced my financial counselor doesn't care about me and it seems that most of the admin are that way, was well. The Riley Center (the gym) is great, though.",

You have the campus in a mid size southern city in a residential neighborhood, and the easily accessible downtown area with culture and food available 24/7. Yes New Orleans is a party city with Mardi Gras, Jazz fest and bourbon street, but Tulane offers an uptown oasis where students can learn from amazing professors in academically rigorous programs. Additionally Tulane might be a small expensive sounding private university, but they offer plenty of financial assistance, both needs based and academic based. The student life in a city like New Orleans is unmatched, if you are smart enough to take advantage of it. I myself was an undergraduate business school student and can say the professors and the programs offered for prepared me and my friends very well for the real world. I found the student body to be diverse despite what the rankings say, with 75% of students coming from 500 or more miles away.",

Nestled in the heart of New Orleans, Tulane offers an academic environment that's as vibrant and diverse as the city it calls home. The fusion of cultures, combined with the university's commitment to community engagement, has deeply enriched my educational journey.\n\nHowever, attending Tulane is not without its challenges. As someone concerned about inclusivity, I feel the university could further diversify its student body and faculty. This diversity is crucial for fostering a more inclusive environment where all voices are heard and valued.\n\nIn summary, my time at Tulane has been filled with learning, personal growth, and unforgettable experiences. The university's strengths in academics, community engagement, and cultural richness have made my college years exceptional. Yet, there's room for growth in areas like diversity and financial accessibility, which I hope to see evolve in the coming years.",

You will feel like a token, you will feel out of place. If you want to spend your college experience watching straight girls make out in frats, this is the place for you. There is no “queer community”, just the few gay people you can find and therefore have to be friends with. From the way people dress to what they talk about, it’s a student body completely centered around straight greek life. If you come from a homophobic background this will be better, but if you ask any queer person from the North, they will tell you how disappointing it is here.

It is one thing to study abroad after experiencing the growing pains of college in a normal environment this is another awful debilitating experience.  This robs kids of the ability to go to college, establish a network of friends, participate in clubs and sports, and join Greek life.  Everything you see posted online, orientation, convocation, club days, football game, homecoming and parent’s weekend you and your family will be excluded from.  All of the clubs have try outs either in the Spring for the next year or the Fall for that year so Spring Scholars are excluded from all clubs and sports for an entire year.  They are forced to live with upper classman who already have an established network so even their roommates alienate them.  They start out behind on coursework and have to take an extra year to catch up (don’t believe Tulane when they say otherwise).  Kids ony have four years in college and Spring Scholars ruins the experience.",

Many of my best friends also struggled and felt like many of the programs advertised were surface-level and not reaching the target audiences. Tulane is great for extroverted students but turns a blind eye to struggling introverts. \nThe president is another example of this surface-level, front-facing imaging the university displays. On paper, he looks very smart and qualified for the position. In reality, he is very aloof and takes a neutral or even no stance on issues that should matter to him and his students. If there is an incident on campus, in the US, or a major global incident, he will send out a generic statement from his office. When he walks around campus, he is treated like a celebrity and is flaunted at sporting events. \nI would like to see the university actually connect with their students.",

What an incredibly manipulative way to ask kids to demonstrate interest in a school and then use that interest to have them make up for lost tuition.  I looked over everything on the admission page and nothing says applying ED can result in a compromised inferior college experience by being admitted as a Spring Scholar.  My child’s SS experience was miserable.  By the time they made it to Tulane in January it was difficult to make friends and every Greek house cut them giving the reason they were a SS.  The SS counselor couldn’t be bothered to meet with them to help make up for the late start and lack of courses available in the Spring they needed.

The University supplies students with an abundant amount of opportunities within their majors, diversifying portfolios by taking classes outside of their majors as well, providing students with support systems such as Case Management, mental health providers or academic advisors when a student needs further assistance sometimes if they're struggling with balance, and time to enjoy going out and exploring the scenery and unique atmosphere of New Orleans. The only downside many students pertained to was the balance between school work and social life and the cost of attendance. I myself really need help with paying for my college tuition which is around $83,000 a year and I didn't know how hard it would be with a single mother who is a nurse practitioner still trying her best to help with everything yet it's not enough. Tulane needs to provide students with more financial care along with teaching students how to be responsible with balance.",

This year the Italian program had no housing despite Tulane promising housing would be provided and visas were difficult to get (some didn’t come in time and kids were left stranded).  Tulane leaves these students high and dry and just tells them DON’T COME TO NEW ORLEANS AND TRY AND MAKE FRIENDS SO YOU HAVE A NORMAL COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.  Starting Spring semester was painful and ruined the college experience all together.  There are no opportunities to connect with others.  Seems like a way to defer a lot of full pay qualified students to make room for those who are not, knowing they will drop out.  Incredibly manipulative and on the verge of being unethical.  Students should be treated as more than just a way to make up for lost tuition through attrition. I would have rather they rejected my child then admit them as a SS.

Growing up in Wisconsin, there was a limited amount of diverse experiences that I was exposed to.  Additionally, most of the professor's are great, they are engaged with the students and value the classroom experience. Moving on to an aspect of my experience that was not so positive, was finding out that work study jobs are not guarenteed and that their health insurance is mandatory for all students if you do not have a \"sufficient enough\" provider yourself. As someone who was heavily relying on financial aid and scholarships, this was extremely schocking.

Of course, we live up to the party school reputation, but it doesn't mean you have to be a party animal to enjoy it. I will note that the admissions here are incredibly focused on demonstrated interest. They want to push the acceptance rate down by increasing their yield (which has worked very well). If you want to come here, you have to apply for either Early Action or Early Decision. Also, make sure they know that you really want to go here. Put some effort into the \"Why Tulane?\" essay and make sure to either visit or be very engaged virtually. There are online events and virtual tours that you can attend and sign up for.

If you aren't a partier, finding friends isn't impossible, but it can be a little harder. Also, the diversity is pretty crappy. However, the OMA and OGSD are really awesome if you get involved.\nI really like campus itself, and there's always stuff going on. Actual downtown New Orleans is pretty far away, but never inaccessible. Weirdly, our dining hall food is not very good, but there are so many cool restaurants to try with friends or family. I'd really recommend having people come visit you - it's a great way to get out and about to visit the city in a more touristy way. Overall, Tulane is a really cool place, with lots of academic freedom, and it's a great option for a prestigious education without so much pressure.",

Tulane has a very flexible course structure and for sure embodies the title of “Liberal education” (not political terminology). However with this flexibility comes a huge responsibility on the student to create a structure that works for them. You must be prepared to speak for yourself and keep yourself in line in an environment that has ALOT of distractions. The 5 stars comes from my absolute love of this school, student culture, and city despite some legitimate qualms and challenges I’ve faced here. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you love to open yourself to new experiences and a challenges you will have a fantastic time.",

Dull moments hardly exists on campus due to amount of activity going on a day-to-day basis, along with that, is the beauty of the campus. It's a very appeasing to the eye view strolling down McAlister Place, and to the nearby Audubon Park. The academics are demanding, sometimes unreasonably so but that is a part of the challenge, I like to think.",

Everyone was smart but no one was competitive about it. Intially I was an economics and international development double major  but because of a study abroad trip I ended up adding French as a third. I'm thankful for the opportuntiy to explore different interests!\n\nIn terms of social life: I was not a big partier and still found my group of firends and took full advantage of the city.

Unfortunately, a pair of teachers soured it - my Calculus 2 teacher and one of my Literature teachers. The former was a tenured old man who, if you didn't show up on time, would lock his classroom door. The administration didn't care to do anything about it, as again, he was tenured, so I had to suffer a near failing grade because the walk from my previous class was more than ten minutes long. My second teacher was, to put it plainly, stoned out of her mind during class, and couldn't teach us for anything. It's the one and only class that I have ever gotten up and walked out of.",

As a sophomore, you are also required to pick a meal plan. All of them are also $3,475. As a sophomore, you have 3 options, all $3,475, the best deal being TU7.\n\nTU 7: --- $3,475\n7 meal swipes\n$1000 wave bucks\n$50 nola bucks\n\nTU 8 --- $1,295\n8 meal swipes\nOptional add on wave bucks or nola bucks\n\nJuniors, who get to pick whether or not to get a meal plan, get to pick TU8. As you can see, TU8 is significantly cheaper and even if you chose to add on $1,000 Wavebucks and $50 nola bucks, it would be $2,345. \nMy point is TU7 is $3,425, but if Sophomore's could get TU8, you could get a very similar plan for $2,345. However, they do not offer TU8 to us because they love to capitalize on overcharging us in WHATEVER WAY THEY CAN. If this didn't make sense go to the Tulane Dining Plan website.",

Though there is a lack of diversity, the multitude of multicultural organizations (at least this year) are really trying to support minority students.

However, the administration is usually pretty receptive when they're not sweeping things underneath the rug. Combined with Ivy-like academics and research opportunities, I'm not concerned about my future.

It offers the opportunity to fully experience the \"fun\" side of college, while still being extremely academically rigorous and requires an immense amount of effort if you want to do well (academically). New Orleans is also an absolutely incredible place to be able to attend school. The professors are absolutely amazing and intelligent and if you put in the work, it will be absolutely worth it post graduating. I love Tulane so much and wouldn't have wanted to attend school anywhere else.",

Part of that is having an incredible academic atmosphere with some of the best professors in their fields, which I am incredibly grateful for. I have found problems in Tulane's reluctance to acknowledge their faults and their privilege. There is the tendency to sweep issues under the rug to preserve their sparkling exterior. They don't want to loose donors and, I think, in the process they forget about the lives of their students, the prospectus students, and the surrounding New Orleans community.",

This can be any type of school that you want, but it skews towards being a party school. Maybe this is just because I'm a freshman. Although there are many students that don't go out all the time, it can feel like that. There is a huge party culture. As a result, it can seem like no one really cares about academics.  The positive side to this is that it isn't a high pressure school.  You will have a happier existence than you would at UChicago or MIT.",

Tulane deserves a C- or maybe even a D when it comes to diversity of the student body. Lots of rich kids. Lots of them. Lots of partying. Its a good school for people that want to study business or finance -- not because the business curriculum is rigorous, but because the students you will network with while in the business school are kids whose parents own companies. You will network with students whose parents can get you jobs. Its a good school to study STEM at because the classes are easy to get into. The computer science department is too small and I don't recommend trying to study Computer Science at Tulane. Physics and Math are really good majors at Tulane because you can finish them in 6 or 7 semesters if you are willing to take a heavier course load. Core requirement classes are an annoying waste of time and money but its nice that the class sizes are relatively small.",

The wide selection of majors and minors allows students to pursue not just one, but many of their passions. For example, the Creative Premedicine Scholars Program gives students the opportunity to major in the School of Liberal Arts while also fulfilling pre-medicine requirements. With automatic acceptance into Tulane University's School of Medicine, the program does not require students to take the MCAT. Tulane has a beautiful campus and is constantly adding to their renovations. The Commons, moreover, is an all new dining room that offers students with a wide variety of fresh, delicious food options. The dorms are a work in progress, as some are nicer than others.",

In the college search process, I knew I wanted to live in a city but still have a campus to walk around. Tulane provides the perfect balance between the classic college campus vibe and the amazing city of New Orleans right outside the campus fence. Tulane in a word is: balanced. Everyone studies hard and cares a lot about their grades, but at the end of a long day of studying everyone loves to go out, whether at the fun frat parties or plethora of college bars. You'll never run out of things to do, on or off campus. The weather is great, the students are all happy and kind, and the place is always just full of good vibes. I have not met a single person who wishes they went somewhere else. If Tulane is right for you, you'll know because when you visit you'll feel the same passion for the school as every student. And if you don't feel passionate about Tulane, it's just not for you.",

            "Review": "The best thing about Tulane for me is the flexibility. Teachers and administrators will work really hard to help you accomplish your goals, even if they're out of the ordinary. With about 7000 undergrads (and growing) it's a good size and most classes are pretty small, allowing you to build relationships with your professors. It's also flexible in the sense that you can be as involved on campus and school-spirited as you like or you can run around exploring the city and both are completely acceptable. I tend to spend my time off campus because New Orleans has a fantastic, youthful energy and great alternative culture. Because the student body is so varied and people are off doing their own thing, sometimes it feels apathetic. For instance there has been a movement going on campus since 2009 to get fair pay for the workers in the dining hall, but the organizers have had a really hard time getting any kind of solidarity from the students.",

If you are going to college so you can be pampered and have a good time, Tulane is the school for you. If you are going to college because you want to get a job in the technology industry, it is the wrong school for you. Very few networking opportunities for STEM students.

I don't care about Greek life & I have friends in every sorority. When I meet girls in class who are in the top sororities though, some how they all happen to be stuck up.

Also, some students don't like feeling like they have to be on a strict schedule as to when they can go to and leave the game, as they have to go by the bus schedule. I think next year when our new football stadium is open our school spirit will see a drastic change as it will be within walking distance, allowing students to get there easily and have school-wide pre games before.",

Tulane boasts that it's the most geographically diverse school in the nation, but the bulk of students tend to come from the NE (NY, CT, NJ, MA), IL, CA, LA, and TX. I wish there was more of a presence of international students on campus.",

Greek life can definitely feel a bit exclusive at times if you're not a part of it. Joining a fraternity or sorority only consumes as much of your time as you let it though. It's easy to have friends who aren't involved in Greek life if you are or vice versa, it just requires putting in the same amount of effort that you would into any friendship.",

While a large percentage of them are extremely privileged and stuck up, there are also a lot of really cool, down-to-earth girls at Tulane, and people often forget this when describing the school. Attending a school with such a high price tag will undoubtedly guarantee that you'll be amongst entitled kids. The boys are pretty similar, a lot of them are incredibly fratty and preppy.",

There are always a lot of people at the first home football game, the homecoming game, and the Tulane/LSU baseball game. Men's basketball is also pretty well-attended. Other than that, though, don't hope for much unless the new football stadium changes things up.\r\n\r\nIntramurals are serious, especially basketball. Some teams even make their own jerseys to play. Club sports are pretty popular, too. Club teams travel and compete all over the country and they're usually a pretty tight-knit group of people.",

About 30% of the total undergraduate population is Greek. For girls, it ends up being about 50% Greek, 50% unaffiliated depending on the year.

Greek life is huge and regardless of what people may seem like (independent or otherwise) when you first get here, most will join Greek life.

There is a subculture of vegetarians, activists, adventurers and environmentalists, but all of those tend to apply to that subculture and you will see the same people in ALL of those club meetings.

Tulane has broad requirements that you have to complete, but a large variety of classes fit these requirements. Being able to study what you're passionate about makes school so much more interesting--I strongly recommend coming to college to learn about something you love, not just to get a job someday.\r\n\r\nI'm a liberal arts major, so there's a lot of reading involved. The best advice I received coming to college was to pick and choose what readings you do, which is easy to do once you feel out the class and professor and figure out what's essential to complete. Otherwise, skimming/finding a summary is okay. I've never felt like the workload was unmanageable, and I'm a big procrastinator. \r\n\r\nThe registration process can be frustrating, especially when you have a later time to register and the classes you're most excited about are filled up. I'd suggest getting on as many waitlists as you need to, and keep checking back if there isn't a waitlist. Just today, I checked a small, hugely popular class that had been filled for months and there was an open spot! There are so many fascinating class options, I'm really satisfied with the course offerings.\r\n\r\nI love to study in my room and at the PJs on Willow, but others utilize dorm common rooms, the library, the LBC, or anywhere outside because the weather is amazing.",

The courses required to satisfy major requirements are of course demanding, but also engaging with various curricula and professors.  The study abroad opportunities are plentifulfor this major, including trips to Costa Rica.  Class sizes vary, though for mathematics and some science courses (based on the ones I've taken thus far) the student:professor ratio tends to be significantly greater, sometimes a bit overwhelmingly so.  Being situated in such an ecologically diverse region, there are many internship and research opportunities here at Tulane, and feedback from friends and upperclassmen who've attended these is usually positive and indicative of personal growth.",

This creates a very personable and interactive atmosphere. Nearly all of the classes are seminars and not lectures. This means that the classes offer the space for your personal input and interaction to learn the material as a group rather than simply being presented with information to memorize. Most of the classes involve paper analysis' of the material you have been learning that ask for your own interpretation and analysis of the topic at hand. The professors are very warm and inviting and allow for great relationships to be developed that if utilized can be extremely beneficial in the anthropology realm after graduation.",

But, after taking a few different classes and working through my Liberal Arts course requirements, I found that Art History and Sociology interested me in a way that the Social Work program did not. The Art History classes are interesting and the professors are so bright, I truly enjoy going to class and completing the readings. The program requires you to take classes from all different genres of Art History, which was initially irritating, but I discovered that I really enjoyed some classes that I thought I would hate. Sociology is an entirely different kind of learning, so it provides a nice break from an all Art History course load. To be honest the material is less interesting, and it's really hit or miss in terms of good professors, but it's fascinating to take a sociology course in a city like New Orleans. You get hands-on experience and outlooks that are really on available in this city. Hopefully I'll get accepted to Teach for America and be able to get experience as a teacher before applying to grad school!

I love my business class, the teacher is funny and interesting and cares about her students. I also love my theater class, my teach is brilliant and entertaining, and I have learned more from his class than I did in 4 years of high school theater. On the other hand I have some professors who don't challenge me at all and whose classes are a joke, and some where the teacher is so removed from the class that they can't see how bored the students are. I here the classes are better in the honors program.",

Decent shopping (in Metarie and Downtown that is) Can be unsafe however if you don't watch yourself. In addition, Tulane kinda traps you in a bubble by not allowing cars on campus for freshmen. For instance, people have to plan to go to somewhere as simple as Wendy's and spend money on a cab (see what I mean). But however, Lets just say there is a definite reason Tulane includes New Orleans in their promotional slogan.",

Transportation around the city of New Orleans is slightly more complex though. Tulane is nestled in the uptown area of the city, and to visit the historic downtown area can be pricey. There is a street car that will get you there in about 20 minutes for about $1.25, but you can be waiting for as long as 0:45 minutes before a car arrives at your stop. The streetcar runs for most hours of the day and night. Other than that, a taxi cab may be your only option sometimes and can run you $20-$40 depending on how far youre going.",

            "Review": "New Orleans public transportation is not known for its speed or reliability. Most students get around by taking the streetcar, which will get you where you need to be \"eventually.\" At first the streetcar ride is charming, but once you have lived here for a while and actually need to be somewhere on time, it can be a pain. Also, the line has been under construction for the past year, and progress is happening at a glacial pace. You need to take a bus and then get a free transfer to the streetcar to get downtown. A 15 minute drive ends up being a 45 minute endeavor. It's not as bad as it sounds, but no one should come here expecting the timely transportation of other cities. You can also take the bus, which travels at a more normal speed, but students barely use it. Cabs are fairly priced, but during certain times of year, the lines can be so busy that it's impossible to get one. You always end up where you need to be, but the process can be aggravating.",

Coming from Louisiana, sometimes I feel very restricted; however, the streetcar/buses are available to bring you downtown or to a suburb for the mall. Parking passes seem pretty pricy, but I'm sure they're no more expensive than other private universities. The parking on campus is pretty bad, though. The roads are terrible! Also, the reason that freshmen are not allowed to have cars on campus is because there is such limited availability for parking. Tulane is a growing university; however, there is no place for it to expand. Overall, I do not think having a car on campus is completely necessary. Yes, it does make grocery shopping easier, but my two feet (and my friends' cars) are enough for me!",

A streetcar ride from campus to the quarter is about fifteen minutes and $1.25. It runs all night long, although the pick-up intervals will be far and in-between.\r\n\r\nI have walked to concert venues, restaurants, the quarter, and friends' houses while living on campus, and I have never had to walk too far.",

The first few months of the semester and the final weeks of May are tough to walk to classes in, but this also means that the winters are pretty mild. The city is very humid, so though the heat is painful, the winters can feel worse than they actually are. It gets to be in the 40s and 50s in the Winter, sometimes climbing up into the 70s! It's very inconsistent. Springs and Summers are rainy, so bring umbrellas and rainboots!",

Since the city atmosphere brings violence and carjackings with it, it is crucial to park your car on campus where the campus police are responsible for protecting it. However, year-long parking passes cost $500, which will put a hurt on anyone's wallet. Since public transportation in New Orleans is so good, why not save yourself the hassle of parking and skip the car altogether?",

The campus blends gracefully into residential neighborhoods and local restaurants, which provide classy and safe diversions for students. There are plenty of coffeehouses, restaurants and clothing boutiques within easy walking distance of campus, so students are never bored. The St. Charles streetcar is only a fifteen-minute walk from the dormitories, making it very easy to get to the French Quarter and Downtown. Bets of all, the surrounding neighborhoods have a very positive attitude towards Tulane's presence in uptown NOLA.",

During midterms and finals it is difficult to secure a computer. I would recommend that you have your own personal computer. You receive $25 for printing each semester, and one page costs 10 cents (you have the option to print double sided). I have found that $25 per semester to be inadequate because I take classes that require more reading and writing. For some students, however, the $25 dollar amount is more than enough. If you run out, it is very easy to add more money to your account. The network is fairly reliable. Sometimes it stops working, but its usually back up withing a few hours. For a college campus, its about average.",

Reily, Tulane's fitness center, is currently a little small, but is undergoing renovations to make it bigger and nicer. It has multiple basketball and racquetball courts, an indoor and outdoor pool, and two exercise classrooms which offer a wide selection of classes. The library is also a little small, but is likely to be renovated in the next few years. Particularly during finals and midterms, the library can feel cramped. It does, however, boast a large collection of books. The student center (the LBC) is a beautiful building that has dining and study space. It is entirely eco-friendly and houses many of the campus activities. Tulane has a large list of clubs and organizations, all of which can be seen on Tulane's website under \"Student Life.\"",

Although there is the full-ride Dean's Honors Scholarship, there is not much else for students looking to remain at the school for all four years. Tulane increased its tuition costs this past year, and although the cost is usually downgraded by a student loan or scholarship, the years pile up, and in the past the financial aid office has not been available for much help. \r\n\r\nThe financial aid office was revamped this past year to offer more beneficial services though, so I suppose time will tell. Until then - I will be on the look-out for outside scholarships that can at least cover the cost of books.",

The workers at the Financial Aid Office are very friendly and helpful. When I had questions or problems, I just walked into the office and was helped right away. There are, of course, tons of forms you have to fill out (FAFSA, CSS, copies of W2s, non-filer forms, etc), but that would be the same at any school. I suggest that you befriend your financial aid adviser and stay on top of deadlines.",

Personally, I got the Dean's Honor Scholarship which covers 100% tuition. They give that out to 100 applicants a year. I still end up paying around $5000 a year in various fees and books, but it's nice to know I won't have any loans. Most of my friends got the presidential scholarship which I think covers around $20000 a year.",

You can get a vegan dog, or a kosher one. How about trying a crawfish dog, or maybe some alligator. Of course, beef is also an option. Though they're a little on the more pricey end, about $7 a hot dog, they're definitely worth it. They're a  hit at school! But they only take cash, so that's a little inconvenient when you forget.

By either walking, taking the bus, or simply traveling by streetcar for only $1.25 you can get to just about anywhere in the city. Most dining options in the uptown area collaborate with the University and offer some sort of student discount or coupons specifically for students. There is even a growing list of dining options nearby campus that are now accepting money on your student ID included in your meal plan to pay for your meals. New Orleans is a city of great cultural diversity and therefore great diversity in variety of dining. Almost any type of food desired can be found within reasonable distance of campus.

            "Review": "Can Get Very Tiring – Bruff is the only traditional dining hall on campus. Because of this, it is very easy to get tired of the food that is available. While there are other options, they require the use of wavebucks (250 of which are given with the meal plan) or money out of your pocket, which means that many students eat the majority of their meals in Bruff. The other option is to go to Loyola's campus and eat in their dining hall (called the OR but referred to by Tulane students as 'Luff'). This does provide some better choices and a change of atmosphere that keeps things from getting too stale. If you are willing to spend the money, there is a lot of great food to be had on and around campus, however - a favorite is late night crepes.",

This past spring semester, Tulane had installed a new bakery with freshly baked treats and even amped up the healthier options. What is still unfortunate is that for vegans and vegetarians, the options remain locked in a freezer behind the \"my kitchen\" line, which offers a varying meal every day. \r\n\r\nAlthough the vegans and vegetarians do not have as many options, the variety that Tulane is trying to bring to its main dining hall, Bruff Commons, is increasing every semester.",

However, some of them are really great for the taste and the price such as Felipe's, Little Tokyo, and Camellia Grill (standard American burger joint). These are within walking distance and offer some variety in flavor. Other restaurants are so-so. The food is basic and decent but not really worth the price. In my opinion, Superior Grill (tex-mex) is extremely overrated. (Go to Felipe's instead.) By the way, there's also a drive-thru daquiri place you can walk to. You'll learn that that's how things go in New Orleans.",

Magazine St., a short walk or streetcar ride away, has restaurants of every price range and cuisines. St. Charles Avenue has several restaurants in the Garden District if Tulane students take the streetcar down. There's also a crepe stand steps away from campus on Broadway, with delicious, cheap, fast crepes. It's a popular spot for students.

There really is something for everyone here, from red beans and rice and fried chicken to pizza and the salad bar. Bruff isn't too bad (especially if you are like me and had parents that were horrible cooks), but in the event you get bored, you can head on over to Luff, which is on Loyola's campus, right next door. Luff has slightly better food quality, and not only does your Tulane meal plan work there, also, but you get to meet Loyola students. Just in case neither Luff nor Bruff are appealing, we also have McAlister Market (your Wavebucks work here, and are also part of your meal plan), where you can buy frozen dinners, Ramen, and the fixings for PB&J and the LBC, which has everything from fresh bagels to a Panda Express (your wavebucks work here, too). If none of that works for you, hey, YOU'RE IN NEW ORLEANS. Conveniently located near campus are the Camilla Grill, as well as any number of Italian, French, and Sandwich shops, and we're a short trolly ride from the French Quarter, for authentic gumbo.",

Even the \"nicer\" ones, such as Wall, SoHo, or Willow are not that nice when you compare them to other dorms in America. If possible, get a doctor's note so you can live off campus your sophomore year. It's much cheaper and the houses around campus are way nicer.",

I chose Butler because I had heard bad things about the party dorms and while I go out, I wanted to come home to peace and quiet. Each freshman dorm has its pros and cons; it all depends on what you're looking for personally.

It's well rounded like Butler, but the rooms are much nicer and they are suite style. There is an application to get into it, but in my opinion, it's worth it.

Many houses are near the shopping/food district, while others are closer to the school's campus. There are Facebook groups where people can post questions they have about housing or find possible housemates. A lot of students move off campus junior and senior years, so it is clearly very popular and feasible.",

All of the dorms are conveniently located, with the maximum walking time from one to another under 10 minutes. The vast majority of students move off campus junior year.",

Wall is an extra application, but it's a great community and you don't have to share a bathroom with your whole floor. JL isn't as bad as you'd think and Paterson is a great place for environmentally-minded/vegan or vegetarian people.",

No matter how much you are willing to spend there are nothing luxurious are even nice available to rent near campus. Places are generally crammed together and old, so get used to hearing everything going on around you and don't expect much privacy. If you can afford it, buy a house and rent it out to good friends.",

Living off campus can be much cheaper than living on campus, especially if you are willing to live with a couple housemates.  Most food expenses are significantly lower for those living off campus, as you are not required to purchase a meal plan and meal plans are extremely expensive. Safety can be issue, especially at night.",

I was placed in JL, after my application to another dorm was lost (which is why I gave a B, the housing process leaves something to be desired). However, once there I found a very welcoming atmosphere and the girls on my floor became very close; it was also much, much cleaner than Sharp or Monroe. Besides Wall, I think it is one of the most enjoyable housing options available to freshman. The options for upperclassmen are much better, however, with new dorms like Weatherhead and alternative options like the apartment-style living of Willow.",

So they are party dorms, with things getting broken all the time, plus they are rather dirty. Other dorms, such as Willow and Wall, are much nicer. They have kitchens, laundry rooms, lounges, and more on every floor. Plus you have your bathroom and sink. They are also well kept, and just overall very nice. They are slightly farther from classes, but still nothing that bad.",

Over the summer the rooms were freshly painted and equipped with new furniture not to mention the rooms are huge compared to the rooms in other co-ed dorms. The showers are also more personal including a space to dress and un-dress. It was also close to a lot of my classes this semester. The only downfall is that it is the farthest dorm so it is a walk but you get use to it fast. As far as the other freshman dorms (sharp & monroe) I would say they are okay nothing special, livable.  I would label the honors dorm wall as the best and if you have time apply to live in these dorms it's well worth it. Sharp & Monroe are more of the party dorms but JL is still very social.",

Neither of the two main freshman dorms (Sharp and Monroe) is anything close to luxury, but both are very social and fun, and will help you meet people who will be your best friends. Irby and Phelps are the two most popular sophomore buildings, which are a bit of an eye-sore, looking like motels. However, this campus housing makes up for the lack of fraternity and sorority house by giving students the opportunity to live in suites of eight people sharing a bathroom. Another popular option for sophomores in Mayor which have suites of singles and doubles. Upper classmen housing isnt great, but is offset by the gorgeous, plentiful and cheep off-campus housing must students chose instead.",

            "Review": "Student Friendly Campus in Beautiful New Orleans – Tulane's campus is in the heart of Uptown New Orleans and is surrounded by a diverse selection of restaurants, bars, and boutiques.  The campus itself has been undergoing a bit of updating, starting with the University Center in 2003.  Slowly Tulane has been working to update and renovate the dorms, as well as increase the number of on-campus housing options for students.  All of the dorms are centered around Bruff Commons, which is the main dining hall on campus and houses the mail room and student mail boxes.  As much as your budget will allow, skip the dining hall and explore the amazing restaurants of New Orleans - there are tons of cafes and restaurants within walking distance that can cure any culinary craving you might have!  The city was made for people who love to eat, drink, and be merry!  There are grassy quads to hang out in and lay out to enjoy the warm, sunny New Orleans weather, and a large city park right across the street from the main campus.  When I enrolled at Tulane, the housing process my freshman year was extremely easy, and I was paired up with another girl who still is one of my closest friends.  Going into sophomore year, the drafting process to sign up for housing was a little trickier, but it still worked out well for my friends out, and we got our top pick.",

Rent is pretty good, although it's determined by house so it depends on how many roommates you have. A average shotgun house runs about $1200 a month, so if you have 2 roommates with you that's a cheap $400 a month, which is actually something like the average rent around the area.\r\nThing is, if you want to stay on campus, you can't. There's no guaranteed housing for juniors and seniors, and even the sophomores who have guaranteed housing run a risk of being thrown off campus because there's just not enough space for even all the freshmen and sophomores. Staying on campus all four years is not really an option unless you're really, really lucky or an RA.",

Most tend to work at the laid back pace that gives New Orleans its charm, but are miserable to work with when the AC breaks...\r\n\r\nAlso, a lot of apartments are unofficially \"handed down\" from upperclassmen to their younger friends (especially in frats and sororities). Although it is not that hard to find an apartment in the area if you start looking early enough, this saves a lot of work. A lot of seniors are often trying to get rid of furniture, so you could end up with a fully furnished apartment for a few hundred dollars!",
