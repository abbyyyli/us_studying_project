            "Review": "UC Berkeley offers a challenging yet rewarding experience. Academically, it’s rigorous, with little hand-holding, but there are plenty of resources like office hours and tutoring if you seek them out. The campus is always buzzing with events, activism, and diverse perspectives, making it an exciting but sometimes overwhelming place. Socially, finding a community takes effort, especially in large lectures, but joining clubs, organizations, or Greek life helps. Housing and food are a mixed bag—dorms vary in quality, and off-campus rent is high. Overall, Berkeley is a fast-paced, intellectually stimulating environment that pushes you to grow, making it ideal for those who thrive under challenge and independence.",

It is no secret that UC Berkeley is a rigorous academic institution but the course load can be daunting to many individuals that are used to the high school curriculum that they had to go through for 4 years. However the student life at Berkeley is very supportive and enjoyable which makes it bearable.",

As a cognitive science major on the Pre-PA track, I love how my classes push me to think critically. The academic rigor challenges me, but the collaborative environment helps me grow.  \n\nBeyond academics, I love how social and dynamic Berkeley is, with study groups, campus events, and a strong sense of community. I thrive in this balance of intellectual stimulation and personal connections.  \n\nBeing on the Cal Cheer Team has defined my experience. We dedicate countless hours to training and bringing school spirit to games, yet we are often overlooked as athletes. Despite this, I love the friendships, teamwork, and confidence cheer has given me. Berkeley has made me more driven and resilient, and I’m proud to be part of this university.",

This public university has severe issues regarding funding and overcrowding, and many academic resources are stretched thin. Dorms and student housing are only guaranteed for one year and the size of lecture halls and discussions have considerably spiked in numbers. The teacher-to-student ratio is so high that interpersonal learning or connection is simply not an option. Likewise, the school has structural problems regarding school safety and security. Many crimes have occurred on campus grounds and the surrounding area of the City of Berkeley is not the greatest.",

You pay for the name and education, but the education is what you make of it. It's very possible to take the easiest classes and graduate without having learned anything. A toxic culture of competition/exclusivity/condescension where students value getting the grade above all else. I've seen students go days without sleeping, end up homeless, and forgo their health to outcompete peers. A subset of students are alarmingly apathetic to ethics. You're just a money-generating number. It's truly a survival of the fittest institution where you're on your own from the very beginning: academically, socially, getting a job. The social scene is driven by hyper-competitive preprofessional clubs with sub 5% acceptance rates and multiple round interviews and greek life. Pervasive loneliness. I've seen many struggle to find employment after graduation. Professors are the silver lining.",

The administration takes little to no attention to the students and also lacks the advertisement of all the resources they have.

However, in my experience of the College of Environmental Design, many classes didn't teach much of anything and/or wanted you to learn on your own.  I think that the learning on your own part was fine in High School but in college it was upsetting to be paying professors that would not teach you.  I wanted to go into work knowing how to do my job but instead it was enphasized that they teach how to think and not how to do the work. When I applied to study abroad they even warned us that the colleges abroad had more advanced classes then us.  So it confuses me why UC Berkeley was considered the best public university in the world.  The beauty of the campus, good quality of food, and fun clubs does not compare to the importance of teaching us how to do our job.",

I very quickly (within one week of stepping foot on campus) realized that this was not the case. \nI was born in the US, but grew up in Mexico due to family circumstances. My identity and racial background has thus shaped many of my experiences. I believed Berkeley would be an inclusive space, where students and faculty alike respected these identities and aimed to provide everyone with just, equitable educational experiences. However, that has not always been the case. \nMy experiences have not been uniquely jarring, every single Black of Latine student that I know shares these stories -from being overlooked or even ignored by professors on campus when asking questions, at times, being the only one of our racial/ethnic group within classroom sizes of 100+, applying for hyper-competitive clubs on campus and realizing that again, you are the only one of your racial/ethnic group within the club.

I usually try to maintain a safe distance, but there are times when I have to pass by them since it's the only route to my classes. Another area for improvement is the dining hall food because sometimes it upsets my stomach.\n\nOn a positive note, Berkeley has some of the top professors in the world who do an excellent job teaching.

The university is dedicated to research and creativity, offering a wide variety of programs that encouraged me to explore different subjects and develop a well-rounded view. The professors are not only experts in their fields but also genuinely care about helping students succeed, often providing extra guidance and support. \nEvents like Cal Day and various cultural festivals brought students together, celebrating our differences and fostering a sense of community. One major concern is how easy it is for students, especially those with financial struggles, to access resources. Making more affordable housing available and offering additional financial help for living costs would really reduce this stress, allowing students to concentrate more on their studies instead of worrying about money.",

However being honest the professors here are incredibly knowledgeable but don’t always provide the support you might expect, pushing you to become self-reliant and resourceful. The surrounding area has its challenges, and safety can be a concern; adapting to this environment has been essential. Yet, despite these obstacles, the level of collaboration and intellect Berkeley offers is unmatched. It’s a community of ambitious individuals constantly pushing boundaries, and the challenges have ultimately been worth it, pushing me to grow academically and personally in ways I never imagined.",

Despite the academic opportunities and education offered here, students have effectively zero institutional support once they step foot inside. Every single opportunity is extremely competitive—think thousands applying for a single-digit number of spots for every single interesting thing, the intense grade deflation, ineffective counselors who couldn't care less about your future and view you merely as another data point, navigating resources gatekept by a bureaucratic nightmare, and no career support. You're truly left to fend for yourself in everything you do. Cal is a university where the top 5% have all the opportunities in the world opened to them while the remaining 95% are forced out into the world with no safety net and shaky prospects.

The academics are incredibly rigorous on their own, but this means you have to join clubs and organizations to stay afloat. It sounds bad that you have to in order to get by, but you do, and you quickly realize you would have kicked yourself if you didn't. There is such incredible diversity in the things you can do here, from fashion shows to formula 1 engineering, you name it. The community is so vibrant and beautiful and the area is so rich with culture, you will want to grow old here. I just wish the food and housing was better, because then it would be perfect.",

The Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs) are usually more helpful than the profs. During lower division years, you will be hard pressed to find good academic resources/support. Undergrad teaching assistant do not get paid evenly across courses. If you teach in Chem or Eng, you could make a good salary, while TAing in Public Health was not compensated at all. I know this led to a class action lawsuit recently, proving that payment shouldn't be so disparate across disciplines.",

As a public university, Berkeley appeared more open to newly emerging affairs and is less stubborn than maybe other campuses. By accepting innovative methods/concepts, UCB broadens the options that students have to choose from. For example, UCB offers certain majors and minors that are relatively new, which other more conventional schools may not have).  This, in addition with the big student body (which incorporates a great diversity, thereby gathering the “elites” in all different fields. By that I mean really professional students  in different fields, the ones that I’ve explored include film, dance, musical,etc.) creates a huge platform for students to engage in some of the worldly high class professionals in almost any field one can think of.",

Some things can be frustrating sometimes such as applying for classes, finding resources, and having intrapersonal interactions with professors and classmates due to Berkeley being such a large institution. Additionally, there are other inconveniences such as the lack of housing for students which in my opinion, needs to start being a priority for the administration. Overall, UC Berkeley has a lot to offer and it is truly what you make of it.

This first year taught me to advocate for myself in taking charge of the education I want to receive and controlling what I want to get out of this degree. I became proactive in attending healthcare seminars which hosted outside speakers, reaching out to industry professionals in medicine to chat and taking initiative in student run clubs to get the most out of all of the resources available on our Campus.

Each school possesses its own distinctive personality, and Berkeley stands out for its constant engagement with societal issues. The university maintains a steadfast connection with the broader community, addressing pressing social concerns head-on. Students at Berkeley are remarkably passionate about effecting meaningful change in the world. Whether through activism, research, or community involvement, there's an undeniable drive among students to make a difference. Berkeley fosters an environment where such aspirations are nurtured and supported, instilling in its students a sense of purpose and a commitment to contributing positively to society.",

Teaching staff was consistently helpful, responsive and even kind to me as a student. I deeply enjoyed zooming through a beautiful campus to get to class. \nThe one aspect of life at Berkeley I wish was different was the lack of safety on and near campus. Almost daily email alerts about another assault or theft would demoralize me. I always moved through campus on high alert, which added stress to an already stressful environment. \nOverall, I will always cherish my time at UC Berkeley and I feel deeply blessed to have attended.",

If you do get housing as a freshman, there's a decent chance you'll get put in a temporary room - a lounge room converted into a quad - at the same cost as a standard room, and with the stipulation that the university may reclaim the room at any point throughout the year. The off-campus housing market is cutthroat, and it's not uncommon for groups to offer to pay ~$1,000 more a month in rent to outbid other contenders.",

            "Review": "Berkeley is an absolutely amazing place to go to school. The campus is very unique in that each building has its own distinct style. While there is a very strong campus culture, and you can almost always find people there (unlike some other campuses that can often feel dead), you still feel very integrated into the surrounding city. This is probably due to the fact that the dorms are not on campus (although they are right across the street), and students only live in the dorms for 1 year, making it so that most students are living off-campus in the city. Depending on your preference, this could be a negative or a positive, but overall I would say it is a positive because most of the time it is usually just one or the other.\n\nPersonally, I would have preferred to have dorms on campus and stay there all 4 years, but I do think that my experience better prepared me for life after college. The only other downside I can say about the campus is that it is a bit hilly.",

The people who crap on Cal are people who don't know how to make friends and don't leave their room. It's just like real life--social life isn't going to come to you, you have to get yourself out there and not be a freaking weirdo. Academics are pretty difficult, but there's help if you seek it out. That's the thing. Everything you need is there, it's just that nobody is there to give it to you. Grow up and seek stuff out on your own. Your mom's not here to hold your damn hand anymore.

But once I was settled into my classes and found a good group of friends, I began to enjoy it and can't imagine having gone anywhere else for undergrad. I think the experience you have is largely dependent on your willingness to take part in your classes, be open to learning new things outside of your comfort zone, and being social enough to find friends to help get you through college. Study something you're passionate about, but also take as many classes outside of your major as you can because there are so many interesting classes offered at Berkeley and it's an amazing space to broaden your horizons.",

The campus itself is beautiful and offers a plethora of resources for students. However, as a Latinx student, it was initially challenging to find a sense of community. Fortunately, I have joined several clubs where I have found a supportive and welcoming Latinx community. The professors at Berkeley have also been very considerate and genuinely care for their students. However, the campus surroundings were a bit of a shock, as there is a high level of crime and homelessness in the area. While I wouldn't say it's unsafe, it is important to be cautious when walking around at night. Overall, my experience at Berkeley has been eye-opening and has allowed me to grow as an individual.",

Most classes were the style where students just listened to the teacher lecture and could ask some questions at the end but otherwise had little interaction with the lecturer. However, most classes required discussion sections which allowed students to get help from graduate student assistants and have an open space to talk with classmates about what was being taught. There were a good amount of food options around the campus area but there were also a lot of empty spaces. The campus's cafeterias did not offer the best quality food. The campus and surrounding area felt unsafe at times with random people walking up to ask for money while I was on campus, a person running on campus while on fire, a school shooting scare, an actual shooting outside one of the dorms, and other incidents. My first year was fully online because of the pandemic and my second year I was denied housing in the dorms.",

Don't let the pretentious students or elitest tenured professors make you feel like you're not meant to be there. Berkeley should prioritize students and not outdated tenured professors who don't know how to teach, but are only faculty because they are there for research.

Overall, I love the traditional aspect and how liberal this school is, it really enables you to seek beyond an education.",

Many of the times, the class average is so low that professors would have a crazy curve just so that 80% of the class doesn't fail (but I guess that's every prestigious school). The area around it is very sketchy making it unsafe for students who have classes during the evening. Majority of the classrooms have no ac/heaters and very little ventilation. I was honestly surprised that it didn't violate any health codes. However, that being said, I do enjoy the various food places nearby and the cute small shops that are available. Because Berkeley is basically just a small little college town, you really can walk everywhere and it overall is just very convenient. GSIs are very friendly and always willing to help to the best of their abilities and many stem majors provide various resources for students.",

She's super helpful and has made my time at Berkeley a lot easier. I would like to see an easier way for students to enroll to classes they need easier.

It's a place where students from various backgrounds and cultures come together, fostering a rich and diverse community. Lastly, Berkeley has a reputation for fostering an environment that encourages creativity, entrepreneurship, and innovation. The proximity to Silicon Valley and the Bay Area's tech industry provides students with unique opportunities to engage in startups, technology, and innovation.",

People are generally welcoming but in terms of friend groups and social relationships, there seems to be some underlying colorism present and POCs aren't as openly accepted in certain homogenous groups. Harder to put yourself out there but you are always rewarded for your persistence. Dining hall food isn't amazing, but they keep improving. Dorms for freshmen are overall at most decent, but housing for upperclassmen is very good. Lots of great opportunities to make a name for yourself and work with top tier researchers. This is a very much work hard play hard school with decent but overpriced eateries nearby and pretty close to where the action is. Stay safe by always carrying self defense tools on you.

There was no need to fight amongst each other. Additionally, all my professors were more than willing to help when it came to studying, or confusion with material. The only downside was the amount of time I had to do it all: study, socialize, research, and work a part-time job. There are plenty of student organizations and weekly activities. You meet wonderful people, and you have stories that you can only get at Berkeley. As for the downsides, such as living off campus, you had to manage your time to make the bus or have enough time to walk up the hill. A rainy day makes everything worse. I would like to homeless crisis change. I saw so many homeless people out at all times of the day. Not just in People's Park, but closer to Telegraph and Shattuck. Once you go past Hearst, or below Blake, the amount of homeless drops off.",

My first semester, many UC employees went on strike, despite this, they were all still very supportive of the students and understood the abruptness. Many students also stood alongside them. The reason I give it a 3/5 is because of some of the professors and the university's lack of acknowledging that they are not being fair or reasonable. I and many other students in the Disabled Students Program had our professor ignore our accommodations and when we said something about it, the school had said that the professors are not forced to follow them. Not only this, but some professors did not grade anything in a reasonable time. Many students in math classes especially struggled because they never knew what their grade truly was.",

However, UC Berkeley is also crime-ridden, and they have either not-enough staff, or they accept to many students. Students will not have guaranteed housing, even as first-years, and they will experience delays in their financial aid and documentation status. There is not enough staff, very clearly, to manage residency forms, and end up charging legal California residents out-of-state tuition until they can prove themselves residents. They take their time—which financially affects many of their students. \n\nDorms are unsafe and robbed often—students are forced to purchase additional security for themselves. Homeless people walk around campus doing crazy stuff, including but not limited to flashing students.\n\nIt’s a historic and beautiful campus. Staff is amazing and professors are fantastic.

However, the professor that teach lower-division class are super helpful and want you to succeed so they use the point system instead of the student competing with each other.

Though most aspects of Berkeley are outstanding, I would want to see the music department and their Student Musical Activities improve. The Cal Band has a lot of instruments for its students to use, but the vast majority of these instruments are either very old or heavily weathered.

Many greek houses, mostly unaffiliated at this point, have horrible reputations. Greeks alone are perceived as typical Cal students, but collectively the worst comes out. They are the main (if not only) source for large parties and with Berkeley not being the most entertaining city like SD/ SF/LA, they are a huge part of entertainment here.",

I am in a sorority where there are a wide range of women, many of whom thought they would never ever join a sorority.  There are girls who go to parties and drink, and girls who never do, and all of them are very studious. I think Berkeley Greek life breaks most stereotypes. While there may be the stereotypical rude blonde sorority girl or obnoxiously fratty guy here and there, there are many genuine people with interests and goals way beyond Greek life. I have made a lot of my best friends in my sorority, but still have friends outside of it through involvement on campus. \r\n\r\nThere are also almost always parties on weekend nights and often small mixers on tuesday-thurs. The weekend parties range from 500 people themed ragers to mixers between one sorority and one frat. The only night where it might be hard to find people getting drunk is Monday. It is definitely harder to get in if you're a guy not in Greek life. \r\n\r\nAnother plus to Greek life- The housing for women is awesome and generally a lot cheaper than dorms.. The frat houses are grimey but are fun because they're all on a real \"greek row\", which really adds to the collegiate atmosphere. Check out Piedmont Ave South of campus on google maps!",

Regardless of how much you care about the game, there are always events surrounding them, such as the Greek row day-ragers before every football game and the whole campus going all out for \"Big Game Week\" before our annual rivalry game with Stanford. The best part of the sports scene is there isn't a lot of pressure to be super into the technical aspect of the sport.  It's okay to just get drunk (or not) wearing blue and gold and screaming \"Go Bears!\"\r\n\r\nAs a non-athlete, it's fun to partake in the Pac-12 sports enthusiasm as well as use the facilities. The Rec Center (RSF) and the other gyms on campus are mostly well kept and open, and have regular work out classes available to anyone. The memberships are also free, which is a huge plus.",

I love my sorority and I think that almost everyone is happy with the mutual selection process. The rush process is not very intense which I really appreciated.  I think that Greek life is known for partying and philanthropy to non-Greeks which is equally good and bad so take what you will from it.",

There are also club teams for people who miss the level of competition (or a higher level) they had in high school and the feeling of being on a serious team.  Varsity Sports are pretty intense and some are the best in the country, (aka Missy Franklin is on the swim team) however I don't think that going to games is a big part of campus life.  The workout facilities are average to good and you get free group exercise classes with your membership which is awesome.",

Some people are exceptionally driven from their past academics, sports, music, or other achievements in their lives. Some people are here to fit into campus, as they felt like an outcast back in high school. And some people, are just here to have some fun. But whatever their main goal is, every person has some kind of belief in them that they live by, and creates a unique balance on campus. As a competitive karate athlete who devoted everything to academics and karate, I had a very narrow perspective when I first came to this school, because I felt that no one would understand my motivation, passion, pressure, stress, and the almost overwhelming joy that I feel from the sport. However, to be here at UC Berkeley, I learned that though it may be in many different shapes and/or forms of expression, that people all had an unique past will drive and passion to get here, and achieve amazing things in their lives now and in the future.",

For instance, I feel that the campus's policy for alcohol use is fairly lenient, and that is a good thing, not because the under-aged students can drink, but because that is a decision that each individual should make at their own risk and responsibility. However, the campus has very strict policies and mentality towards racism, and I strongly agree with the fact how the school strongly supports beliefs that is for the best of most on campus.",

Sink or swim, baby.\r\n\r\n7. You will come out scarred but much, much tougher. No one will hand you your grades or resources, so you learn to be independent. That comes with being a highly-ranked public university - budget cuts make some resources (like advising, classes, library hours) harder to come by.\r\n\r\n8. Regardless, it's still a rewarding experience. You'll be around Nobel Laureates, peers who are freaking geniuses, classes that blow your mind, and a long legacy of Cal pride.",

The workload is doable and understandable if you manage your time efficiently.  \r\nMy major is a composition of all the sciences: Chemistry, Biology, and Physics.  Mathematics is also a requirement.  None of them are easy, so be prepared, especially for Chemistry.\r\nLanguage classes are intense as well.  Whether you are a native speaker or not, be prepared for the rigor.",

It's honestly the best of both worlds; you can attend the large public school but have a smaller community of students that you see practically every day and interact with over four years. There are so many professors doing so many types of research. With some perseverance and genuine interest, you can work on their graduate students' project from freshman year onward. The national ChemE club, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) has several resources for ChemE majors. Although I'm still deciding on where I want to take my career (you soon realize that the opportunities with a ChemE degree are practically endless), I know I won't have any problem finding a job within 6 months after I graduate.",

The reason why I've never had an internship is because they are usually unpaid - I've paid for my schooling and my cost of living on my own (with help from financial aid) so spending time on an intership that doesn't pay was out of the question.\r\n\r\nFinancial aid (thankfully) gave me a workstudy award, which pretty much means you are placed in an exclusive club that employers pick from. If you have workstudy, it means that the government has agreed to pay half of your salary...thus endearing you to the hearts of most on-campus employers as a very cheap, high quality employee. So far, I've had a lot of luck with workstudy. I've had 4 really good jobs that gave me good experience, good pay, and good networking opportunities. In fact, my current job is so great that my current boss has decided to help me find a paid internship. Yes, folks, my boss is so kind that she has decided to find me a rare gem - a paid internship. \r\n\r\nMoral of the story? If you can't get an intership due to lack of experience, lack of luck, lack of time, or because you need to pay the bills try and get an on-campus job!",

            "Review": "Berkeley is great! There are so many affordable food options, with cuisine from all over the world. There's a downtown farmers market every Saturday and markets on historic Telegraph Ave. during the summer. Campus is great, with its historic campanile, beautiful old buildings, museums, libraries, tree groves, and there's a vibrant atmosphere. Students care about academics and social issues. Football games at memorial stadium are fun. There are great places to catch a magical view of sunset over the Bay and San Francisco. \r\n\r\nTransportation by buses is pretty good - you can get a lot of places with the AC transport bus pass that comes with your UC Berkeley ID card, including SF and nearby Tilden Regional Park (which has hiking, a lake, a little farm, etc). And BART is pretty good for getting to the City. \r\n\r\nDowntown Shattuck has improved over the years. It's not the cleanest, and there are lots of homeless individuals but they do not generally cause any problems. It has it's charm though, and the movie theaters are nice, the trees are wrapped in lights. Some people say that it is dangerous, but it's really generally very safe as long as you take reasonable care like not walking by yourself late at night through the more south & west side areas. There are also really great family neighborhoods of Berkeley, with classic great big Berkeley houses.",

It's a community that has its own character, and people are really friendly - they'll have conversations with you at a coffee shop and you'll end up talking about the local theater scene. There are ton of good restaurants (Chez Panisse is one of the few Michelin starred restaurants in the Bay Area), activities that you can walk to, and if you're ever bored of Berkeley itself, you can BART to San Francisco and spend the day in the big city. \r\n\r\nCal games get a lot of alumni and school spirit, especially since we reopened our stadium. There *is* a large homeless population here and that might be something visitors notice first, but it is rarely ever a safety issue and there are a lot of organizations to volunteer at if you want to help out.",

You will do a lot of walking because cars are actually pretty difficult to keep here, since parking is expensive and there isn't much of it. But exercise is good.\r\n\r\n2. We all get a Class Pass in the beginning of the semester ($71 in our tuition) that allows for unlimited AC Transit rides (bus system) anytime in that semester. This means the bus can reach BART, campus, Amtrak, and anywhere in between.\r\n\r\n3. 51B will be your best friend if you live on the South Side, which many students do. It runs every 10 minutes and gets you to class when you're running late.\r\n\r\n4. Free UC Berkeley shuttles that runs in loops around campus and nearby neighborhoods. You can track where they are online, so you don't have to wait long.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1. Actually none. Outside of having less car-accessibility, Berkeley has great transit options. You can walk, bike, bus, shuttle, drive (it's not impossible), longboard, whatever and get to where you need to be.",

It's my second year and I've barely made a dent since I can't stop myself going back to the same awesome Thai places, food trucks, and cafes.\r\n\r\nThere's a ridiculous amount of character and soul through the whole town, and it's quickly become my favorite place in the world.",

(Even if you're in the middle of campus, two campus-run lines run into/through the center.) It's not much of a concern anyway, since campus is pretty compact. Buses aren't always perfectly on time, but that's okay because around campus there's SO DARN MANY BUSES.\r\n\r\nAC Transit runs throughout the Bay Area and even into San Francisco, and crosses most heavily-student-inhabited areas in and around campus. It's easy and fast to get nearly anywhere totally free.",

The financial aid office is always extremely busy (line out the door) and you have to reapply every year. The best thing is, however, Cal lets you convert loan offers to work study reward (up to $4000). Berkeley's Work Study Program is very efficient in broadcasting job opportunities for eligible students on-campus, off-campus, and in the surrounding area.",

The Berkeley Faculty Club makes good hamburgers, the person who makes them is very friendly, and the S.F. Soup Company makes very good soups. However, the Golden Bear Diner does not always have the Dove Dark Chocolate bars, and I feel that they could have larger cups for their soups.",

In addition, I've gone to the Northside Cafe. Although their soups are good and are cheaper than S.F. Soup, you cannot sample Northside's soups. I've also had lunch at the Aki Japanese restaurant, but while their food is good, they do not have great service and are not particularly friendly. When I went to Cafe Milano for hot chocolate, they did not give me whipped cream with the hot chocolate, and when I called them on the phone afterward about the matter, the person on the phone was very unfriendly. Finally, I sometimes go to Chipotle for lunch, and their food is good.",

I had foothill most times because it was closest to me- food was great on special occasions. Other times you would have the same food for the whole day. It gets tiring after a while. I would advise you to spend your meal points on dining food however go out and eat at other places that accept meal points so that you can get a wide range of selection",

Fenton's is in Oakland with a bus that goes right next to it, and it's worth trying. The prices can be a bit high in some of the better restaurants, but there are great places to eat that are also cheap.

Vegetarian options? Options that involve a specific species of fish? We practically invented them. WE HAVE A RESTAURANT THAT'S ALL RAW FOOD.\r\n\r\n3. It's all good. Even if it's not good, you'll find a restaurant next door that makes you forget any bad restaurant experience.\r\n\r\n4. It's pretty cheap. A dinner option usually comes around $7-9.\r\n\r\n5.

Some examples of the off campus dining choices, Asian-Ghetto(a small circle of cheap but delicious Asian and Mexican food), Purple Kow( A bubble tea joint with supposedly the best bubble tea), bubble tea is everywhere off campus. We also have many bakeries with delicious and excellent priced pastries. We have Cream( ice cream sandwiches that are said to be really good, Cream is open late and has reasonable prices, but there is normally a very long line). Crepes A Go-Go is a crepe joint right off the campus, but its pretty expensive. We have Noahs bagels( which is really good). The best food options would be on Shattuck(5min bus ride, or 15 min walk from campus). There is a really good Thai place, Paris Baguette is an amazing pastry shop, there is a Starbucks, and a McDonnalds. Vegetarian options are everywhere. Almost any  place you go they will have vegetarian options in their own section on the menu and vegan options are also very abundant. Student discounts are not offered very often however, though we do have a Cal1Card that can be used at a few places off campus and there are coupons you can find that only work if you use the Cal1Card. For example Jamba Juice had a buy 1 get 1 free if you use the Cal1Card(debit account not meal points).",

However, I discovered that after a month of eating in the same dining hall every night, I became sick of the food and need more variety. I find myself buying food from markets, or skipping meals entirely, rather than forcing myself to eat food I have began to dislike. Although the food at my specific dining hall has become boring to me, I still enjoy eating at the other dining halls throughout campus, it's just a matter of whether or not you are too lazy to get the food like me.",

Most of the restaurants around campus are small businesses with decent food, but the few chain restaurants they have are disappointing (Subway, Jamba Juice, McDonalds, Starbucks, Peets, etc.). \r\nUnless you want to pay a lot of money, you're stuck with the cheap food around Berkeley and it gets old really fast. Most of the food falls into one of four categories: Asian food, Indian food, Pizza, or Burgers. There is no good Mexican, Italian, or American food around campus, though there are some great dessert places such as King Pins for donuts and Cream for Ice cream. \r\nAll in all, the food is ok. There are a few places that are really good, but besides those, the food options are pretty ok.",

If you are using a Meal Points system it is best to regulate your spending and monitor it closely. The dining halls are great and are all you can eat, but you may get tired of it after a while. I suggest getting the meal plan if you are living in On-Campus Housing if only for the convenience and the variety. It's included so you might as well use it.",

Some of the smaller on-campus options are decent, such as Golden Bear Cafe, and there are some Peet's coffee shops that use meal points, which is nice. But overall, don't expect anything special. The menus at the dorms' dining halls get old VERY fast, and you start looking for any excuse to eat somewhere else.",

There are few places with organic ingredients however most breakfast places serve fresh squeezed orange juice. Jupiter's is great for later dinners and theres a bar there as well as salsa on thursday nights and they have a fire pit outside. Crepe's A Go Go is a very filling and quick breakfast place not too pricy about $6 or $7 per crepe.",

The variety is actually not all that bad, and there are vegan and vegetarian options. There are plenty of places to use your meal points on-campus besides the dining halls during the day. The Late Night menu at Crossroads is decent and is what students spend most of their meal points on. The best place to eat during the day is Cafe 3. Dinner at Clark Kerr is better on average more than Crossroads. Unless you live in the Foothill dorm, trekking all the way up to Northside just to eat at the Foothill dining hall isn't always appealing. Foothill dining hall has a good Late Night menu so making the trip with your friends from time to time is fun. If you want to stock up on snacks and drinks for your dorm room, then the Bear Market in the middle of the Unit 3 dorms is a good place to spend meal points. The meal plan is definitely good for your freshmen year as you adjust to life away from home, but most students after their first year don't buy meal plans again.",

Qualcomm sells delicious handmade wraps and Peet's Coffee is a plus! Crossroads dining hall may the most variety out of all the dining halls, but in my opinion, the food isn't very good there.

I get that rent in the bay area is expensive but I think I'd be better off renting a room off of craigslist or something. The elevators would be out a lot, but I was on a lower level so I always used the stairs. The bathrooms were kind of shabby, I'm very appreciative of the people who kept for them but young adults are messy! Also on my floor there was definitely favorite showers and showers you did not want to use (i.e. one had no flow, another didn't drain). Sometimes people had sex in the showers, some guy recorded me showering once but UCPD handled my report well and the guy was removed from UC housing. He still was able to attend school though? \r\n\r\nMy floor had laundry on it (yay) and the building had no air conditioning so we (my roommates and I) would leave our window open most of the early months. It was loud outside at night so we used ear plugs while we slept. \r\n\r\nThe underground communal space is nice, good study spaces and a little workout room with one working treadmill and some really nice ellipticals.\r\n\r\nI liked being on southside close to Telegraph but I know some people didn't like being near that area.\r\n\r\nAlso there are compost bins in the rooms make sure to empty them if you use them!

It's easy to find apartments in Berkeley for a better price than housing, but they not be as conveniently located to campus!",

There are cleaning services, communal kitchens in each unit, a mini gym, tv rooms, etc. The wifi is problematic, but it's alright.

The dinning hall at CKC is the best dinning hall on campus. A lot of athletes live here and there a lot of students in the GreeK system. I love going to the pool, tennis courts, mini gym, and all the hiking trails right behind my dorm. Also there are a lot of nice grass areas to tan and do homework. The only downside is that it is about a 10 min walk to campus, which is not bad at all and the walk is mostly through a residential area. If you really don't like the walk then you can take the bus which is very convenient and free!",

The housing office isn't very helpful since I know one of my floormates called before the assignments were made asking to change his first choice from a triple to a double and the housing office said they would take care of it, but he ended up getting assigned a double. I also sent a form requesting housing accommodations due to my insomnia and provided the necessary medical documentation, but haven't gotten a response and it's been over a month.",

It is close to the science (excluding plant science), math, and engineering buildings, so it is convenient for those majoring in these fields. The dorm is a bit of a walk up because it's on the side of a hill. One thing to think about is if you live in the unit dorms, you probably have a higher probability of getting sick. This is inevitable in dormitory life, but I think in foothill, there are more windows, and higher air circulation. Also, there's not too much crowding.",

Many apartment complexes have students, so there are student amenities - laundry machines, year-long leases that end in June, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Prices can be somewhat high, but much cheaper than dorms. Plus, you won't have to always use meal points in Crossroads!\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1. Some neighborhoods might be unsafe. There are robberies and muggings, but mostly be aware of your surroundings and try to use campus transportation at night if you're alone (BearWalk).\r\n\r\n2. Parking is expensive. Any street parking needs a permit or it has a 2-4 hour meter limit. Covered parking is around $100 per month.",

Also, the process can be difficult for spring admits because it begins relatively early in the semester and spring admits have only been attending the campus for a short period of time.",

The proximity to campus definitely varies, but with a bike and the bus system, anything is doable. The prices tend to be higher in the bay area, but they are still fair. You can find anything from a studio to around 6-bedroom places.",

However, during my first semester at UC Berkeley, I have discovered that if you want to be social, it is easy.

Most apartments near campus that are a reasonable price have old heaters and washing machines/dryers, and most don't have dishwashers. Landlords sometimes look down on students and take advantage of their inexperience.",
