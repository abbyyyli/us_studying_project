Some students have an elitist mentality, so they are not always nice/open-minded, but it wasn't too bad. The biggest issues I had with BU were the price and the DAS office. I was lucky to have sufficient aid and scholarships, but not everyone is able to access this. Additionally, the student services for disabled students seemed very hit or miss depending on who you met with- I had some friends who were heavily discriminated upon despite significant health challenges asking for reasonable accomodations.",

Going to a big school in the middle of a city can be extremely overwhelming when it comes to finding your \"people\" and the activities/things you enjoy; however, it does get easier as the academic year progresses. I've really enjoyed the atmosphere of the campus and being a college student here. I would like to see more activities being hosted by the School that gage student interest. One of my favorite activities I've done here is pottery painting at a local studio which was hosted by the school; I think if they did more stuff like that it would improve the student life of incoming students as they learn to adjust.",

BU provides access to top-tier professors and cutting-edge research, fostering intellectual growth. The diverse student body enhances classroom discussions and cultural exchange. BU’s location in Boston adds excitement with numerous cultural and professional opportunities. However, the high tuition costs can be a challenge, and despite financial aid, affordability remains an issue. The academic workload can also lead to stress, so more mental health support and work-life balance initiatives would be beneficial. While BU is diverse, further efforts to increase socioeconomic diversity would enhance the student experience.

It's calm and quiet and chances are that a person may see someone they completely don't know a lot of times while passing by the sidewalk the campus runs on. Seeing that \"stranger\" becomes more frequent and its literally how people make friends without verbal communication. Sometimes it's hard to make friends because of how independent everyone is but as long as you aren't in your dorm all day, its impossible to be lonely here. Trees are always friends.

I do not think the money was worth it for me personally because half of my college experience was remote/hybrid but no one was prepared for the pandemic. Should you experience a full four years on-campus, I imagine you will come to love BU’s student environment, the city that offers so much to learn and experience, and what you are studying. BU’s professors have made me passionate about areas I have never previously considered.

Being exposed to this fascinating world of biological diversity for so long prompted me to pursue a career in biology. Nonetheless, a life-changing experience influenced my decision to major in Biology. I almost lost my father in 2016 when his inner brain nerves broke, causing him to remain in a coma for a month. Fortunately, he was blessed and is still here today. After this experience, I am even more driven to study Biology and become a successful medical doctor in the future. I got exactly what I wanted at BU: an amazing biology program and the experience of being somewhere quite different from the place I called home. My classes have been engaging, my professors are supportive, and getting to experience the first snow in a while was such a fun moment. I’m motivated to keep working hard and stay focused on pursuing my passion in this field.",

I'm a sociology major, and I think that the academic advisor for the sociology department is great, I can tell he really cares about his students. I think another plus about BU is the fact that they accept many, if not all, AP credits. Just on AP credits alone, I've accumulated 24 credits so that's a lot of money saved. Also, they are partners with Questbridge and very generous in financial aid if you show demonstrated need, so if you're from a low-income family, BU makes it very accessible to get a degree here as well as many work study-opportunities since Boston is a college city.",

This school is definitely giving me the means to move out of Boston post-graduation and start a productive, fulfilling career. I really enjoy the geographic diversity here; although some  areas are more represented than others (namely the Northeastern U.S, California, and East Asia). As much as I like this school, the environment is very competitive and quite toxic at times. Speaking from experience, I’d say it’s important to maintain a thick skin here. No school is perfect, so I don’t think I’d ever give any college 5 stars. Nonetheless, BU is about as good as it gets. I’d definitely recommend coming here!",

Each dorm is different but I have had multiple rooms that were in pretty rough shape. Diversity here is good in some ways, it’s not uncommon to meet people from any culture around the world and to hear people speaking foreign languages, but making the population more diverse would be beneficial.

The RA's are also currently on strike, impacting housing for students. For a school costing $90k a year, they should be able to pay their employees (especially those who are also students) and keep the school functioning. Beyond these issues, the school lacks a broad sense of community--it can be difficult to meet people, even living on campus. And the administration makes it very clear that \"BU is a corporation\": they will do/spend the absolute bare minimum on students, and for most issues, you will be on your own.

Its strengths include a wide range of excellent programs, particularly in business, law, and health sciences, as well as cutting-edge research facilities. BU’s location in Boston provides students with ample professional and cultural opportunities. However, the university faces challenges such as high tuition costs, which can be a barrier for many students, and concerns about the cost of living in Boston. Improving financial aid packages, enhancing affordability, and addressing campus housing issues could make BU more accessible and support its commitment to fostering an inclusive and enriching educational environment.",

The explicit greed shown by Boston University, especially during the most recent graduate student worker strike and residence life strike, is shocking. The administration made no effort to come to a compromise with either group. There is also no reason as to why Boston University had to have become one of the first to reach a yearly tuition cost exceeding $90k. The price is ridiculous, seeing as though absolutely none of the money that students pay is put into improving facilities, resources, and dormitories that would improve the experience of their students and actually make the cost worth it.",

For the working class, my parents, a funeral is expensive - once I said this, I felt treated differently from that point on. BU prides itself on its diversity when bias is embedded into the entire institution. If this is what it is like for other groups (outside of economically fortunate and white), BU avoids diversity. Though the institution has various issues (see the current graduate worker and resident assistant strikes), the professors and instructors are phenomenal.

            "Review": "Boston University provides top-notch programs led by esteemed faculty members who are leaders in their respective fields. There are vast opportunities for students to be involved in research and internships and the facilities are excellent. That being said, tuition costs are outrageous and the general student body lacks cultural awareness. The administration claims to promote critical thinking, but they are very conservative in their management.",

            "Review": "Boston University is a huge undergraduate school. Therefore, you really have to seek out opportunity and friendships to find them -- it's not the kind of school where everyone knows each other's name. I barely knew the other members of my own major (Neurobiology within the Biology department). However, that's not necessarily the case, as there can be much stronger camaraderie in other departments like the College of Engineering, or even among Physics majors. While there is not a strong sense of school spirit and tradition at BU, unless you specifically seek it out (for example, I was in the BU pep band), I really appreciated the opportunities offered by such a large research institution. I got to break into cutting edge research by connecting with investigators at the Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. I discovered a passion for data science on top of my aspiration for a career in medicine. Plus, it's BOSTON!!! It's an exciting city to live in while young.",

The nice thing about BU Greek life is that you can be involved as little or as much as you want - it doesn't take over your life. It's a great way to find a different group of people to hang out with as well.",

I know that there are several business fraternities and sororities, but they are not allowed to have houses on campus. Many of the members also do not live in Greek Life houses, but live in dorms like the rest of the students. I think most non-Greek students are indifferent to Greek Life, but some pay attention to the social aspects such as parties.",

I have absolutely no problem with that but if you expect full stadiums and die-hard fans then you will be disappointed. Sometimes an upcoming hockey game is the buzz on campus, other times there might be a track meet with only a few cheering fans. There are more than enough club sports and if you are interested you will definitely find one to be a part of",

One of my conditions for choosing a school was that it had to be one with very little Greek life on campus, and Boston University fit the bill. Sororities and Fraternities are there, but their impact on social life is low. Most people are indifferent to them, though many do enjoy their parties. I'd say they make a good impact in the community service scene, though; they fundraise a lot for charity, and that's pretty cool of them.",

We have one of the highest ranked hockey teams in the country! Later in the season, going to a game here is like going to a football game at one of the Big Ten schools!",

            "Review": "I am personally not a fan of any Greek life. A lot are known for sexual harassment and racism. At BU, their only use is to throw parties, and I've experienced things that have reinforced my dislike for fraternities. They seem to be the main source of alcohol, and therefore the fun on campus. Girls are judged by appearance before they can enter and guys are required to be rushing or friends with a brother in order to enter. Sometimes, guys are required to have a good \"ratio\" in order to enter (5 girls per 1 guy for example). I once entered a frat party with my roommate where the theme was \"ABC -Anything But Clothes\" We both didn't want to be too exposed since the weather was getting cooler and we were almost denied access to the party because of it. Later on in the night, my roommate was touched inappropriately by one of the boys who was rushing the frat. She did nothing to encourage these advances, being that she was in a stable relationship and not there to talk to any boys. Another time, I witnessed an unconscious girl being carried out of a frat house because she had drank too much. There is no control of who is drinking and how much. The ambulance was called and I decided to leave. However, I believe this is a problem across all schools, as I have been to frat houses at MIT and Harvard as well, and witnessed similar things. Since sororities rush in the spring, I don't have much to say about them yet.",

There are rooms for any kind activity available, such as dance and yoga classes and basketball.

The sign in process takes a couple minutes at most. It's really straight forward and the security guys are pretty nice about letting people in.",

However, if you're a girl it's very easy to get into frat parties, and most people in greek life or who have friends in greek life go to those. As for social life, it really depends on who your friend group is - if a lot of your friends like to party you might be pressured into joining, but at the same time if your friends are in sororities/frats then you can just go to the parties they invite you to.",

With that being said, grade deflation is a real thing and you can work extremely hard for a class while barely pulling off a B.

It is the school and the advisors responsibility to find you an internship, based on information that you give them. The internship will be difficult because many of the students, myself includes, will also be working full time while trying to fulfill the internship hours, attend classes, and keep up with class assignments. I know this will be a challenge, but I know it is to better my education and work experience for a future career.",

Each class is about 4 weekends long. Classes are taken one at a time which is manageable for full time workers. While the classes move along very quickly the caseload is still heavy. The curriculum is the same as the Boston campus, just very condensed. The students are still expected to cover the same material that the regular classes that run 15 weeks cover, and complete similar assignments. You are often given only a couple of weeks to complete large assignments, and there are readings that are due every weekend. While the caseload can sometimes be overwhelming, if it wasn't for this program I would probably not be able to pursue this degree unless I made some major changes, which was not feasible for me.",

This allows the student to only have to focus on one class at a time. Each class is about 4 weekends., and they take place Friday nights and Saturday mornings. Since the class is only 4 weekends, the classes go by very quickly but are also very intense. The curriculum is the same as the one that is taught on the Boston campus, but is done in 4 weekends as opposed to the typical 15 weeks. The caseload can be heavy at times and there is only a short amount of time given to complete assignments, some of which are research based and long. On the other side, if you love a class or hate a class, it is only 4 weekends. The way this program is set up is ideal for anyone who also hold a full time job as well.",

I found this to be somewhat confusing because I did not attend any orientations or meetings prior to classes starting like the other students who applied did. After a couple of months I started to understand things better. I eventually applied and got accepted as a student. One important criteria for applying was GPA. In order to apply one must have a GPA of at least 3.0.  Overall I think the application process was similar to other colleges. One tip is the online application process. The application is all done online and submitted online. The references that are needed are also done online. The student must include the email address of the reference and a email with an attached form is sent to the reference. Two of my three references had difficulty downloading and filling out the form. My third reference did not want to use the online form at all, so I had to mail that reference in. In today's age it is much easier and quicker to do things online, but sometimes older generations who are not as familiar with computers have difficulty doing certain tasks.",

There is also a high chance of being accepted, although I hear it is becoming slightly more competitive as the years go by. As with any admission process, GPA, rank and standardized tests are the most important factors. Well-roundedness might be a plus. My general tip for applying to college is to take things slowly and carefully because I remember making a few mistakes on my application which might affect how the colleges see you. My particular program for biology was not abnormal although I originally only applied because it was a plan B for the competitive accelerated medical program. BU does give the option of the MMEDIC program to sophomore students (go look it up) which is not accelerated and I don't think it gives automatic acceptance to the medical school, but will be extremely helpful.",

I love it because I'm studying something fairly specialized and the resources I can take advantage of at BU outstanding. There's a huge variety of classes, the professors are all nice and helpful, and I couldn't be happier with what I'm studying. However, getting to the actual class part always seems a little daunting. \r\nRegistration sometimes creeps up on you if you aren't ready for it, but BU has it planned out depending on your year and your student ID number, and the date and time is always posted on the student link which you can access online, which makes it all very easy. Likewise, choosing classes is fairly easy because there's a tracker online for what you need to complete in order to finish whatever major/minor(s) you're pursuing.\r\nThere will always be popular areas of study, biology, for example. I can't speak from experience because I'm not studying something as popular, but registering for those classes is always harder because of the sheer number of students trying to get into them. BU has taken steps so there are more than one section for popular classes, more often than not.\r\nThe possibilities at BU are wonderfully overwhelming. For someone like me who yearns to always be surrounded by new information and material, it's a dream come true. However, the amount of work expected is often straining. Depending on your area of study, the workload can be light, to feeling like you're drowning in it. But of course it also depends how you handle it.",

Though I miss Sunday morning drives in my car, I have become accustomed to a brisk walk to Newbury or just walking down the street to grab groceries. I'm never bored because there are so many things to do in Boston. Downtown and Faneuil Hall have such a great energy this time of year, and Boston Commons in the fall and spring are simply amazing. I feel like there is something for everyone in Boston. I like the fact that it is a pretty small city too, because it allows you to see everything.",

Unfortunately the shuttle does not run during the daytime on weekends, but does run both day and night on the weekdays which is very convenient. Boston's public transport is relatively useful and although buses hardly ever run on schedule, it is possible to get almost anywhere in the city via public transport and there are even commuter trains out to the closer suburbs including Salem. The T can be pretty pricey, but there is a student discount for semester passes though BU which helps. Ultimately, this is a walking campus and a walking city, and walking costs nothing.",

BU is attempting to provide service during weekend days, which will be helpful. The T now charges students regular fair, which is annoying, but it can be helpful and reliable for crossing campus quickly. Taxis are everywhere on east and central campus.",

There appear to be ample computers in study lounges and libraries, and I've never had problems getting a machine when I wanted it or having to find another machine because mine was broken or not well maintained. That being said, I would highly recommend procuring an Ethernet cord if you plan on spending time in your dorm room using the internet (especially for streaming) because the wireless network drops an absurd amount and it can be very frustrating. There's access (however mediocre) almost everywhere on campus, including the BU Beach and other areas outside, so that's a definite plus. I've heard great things about Tech Support here.",

There's ample attractions during the day and a BU ID can get you free admittance to most of them (Parks, museums, etc). The professional athletics in Boston certainly draw in a spirited crowd — the Red Sox won the word series just blocks away from campus, and thousands of people flooded the street in front of my dorm. Memorable! At night there are certainly ample options, but the ID checkers are draconian and punishments can be severe so beware if you are attempting to use a fake ID in the city. My only major gripes are that the nightlife tends to shut down abruptly at 2am and the locals (\"townies\") can be abrasive.",

One of my friends got an internship summer after freshman year, and another has a very good job waiting for her when she graduates, and she's been promised this position for almost a year. Our Center for Career Development (CCD) is very helpful.

            "Review": "First off, the Financial Aid Office's customer service is great. Always remember they mean well and want to help, even when the numbers are higher than you expected. They will almost always waive the late fee, as long as you're communicating. They understand our pain as students because they all were there. My 2 star rating is not intended for them!\r\n\r\nBut really, it's just stingy BU. They don't award much money, especially if your parents filed a tax return extension and BU has to wait around until August for your tax information. However, that part is out of their control because money runs out. Can't argue that one, only can complain. Graduating with debt (usually more than a few thousand dollars) is just a part of the culture here. I should add that I know one or two people here on full scholarship, but this is usually merit-based rather than need-based. Unless you have the money stashed away or you won a full scholarship, you will probably run around looking for money. My real question is: why can we afford smart phones and pretty laptops but not an education?\r\n\r\nMY ADVICE, and please take this advice: Start early!! Don't wait until you're packing for college to look for scholarships--more importantly, don't wait until you're in college. Apply to everything that comes your way. Take surveys like this one, write essays, and enter no-essay scholarship contests daily! Even, or especially, the $100-$600 contests. Just because you run into $10,000 scholarships doesn't rule out the little guys. Those may mean tens of thousands of dollars. To all high schoolers planning on attending college, those tuition bills are coming way sooner than you think, and there is SO much money out there, all you have to do is write a few short essays.",

Also, if you want to study abroad over the summer for example, you're essentially on your own in terms of financial aid. There is some, but not lots.

I don't understand why the financial aid isn't increased significantly so that students can see that the school cares about us and our education and not just the money we are paying. Tuition is very expensive and there needs to be more loans, scholarships, and help for students. I also think that the tuition should be lowered so students won't be burdened. Especially when senior year comes and all the tuition has to be paid before they can graduate/get a diploma. Too many obstacles!",

Considering how expensive BU is, the financial aid office is generally willing to work with you. You can also appeal your package which sometimes leads to more aid. However, there was an article saying that BU makes it hard for students who need the aid to attend and instead give it to smart/impressive students who don't need the money as badly to persuade them to attend.",

In one instance, this led to me receiving a private scholarship for $11,000, so they removed the university scholarship for $20,000.  My -$9,000 winnings weren't very helpful in the long run.

Sometimes the vegan/vegetarian options are disappointing at the dining halls, but there's always the option of salad, pasta, sandwich, soup or pizza. The biggest downside is how expansive a meal plan is. Every semester I have extra meals or dining points that don't get fully refunded so I wish the minimum meals you have to purchase was lower because it's a pretty big waste financially. I actually save money cooking my own food now that I'm in apartment style.",

Sunset has the best nachos ever and T Anthony's is open pretty late. If you're looking for something fancier, the North End is where it's at.",

The best place to eat is Bay State because it has the largest variety of options. Every dining hall has gluten-free and vegetarian options, so there is something for everyone. I believe if you are gluten-free they have a selection of snacks t grab in the dining hall exclusive to gluten-free students. you just have to call the dining services and have them allow your card to swipe into the room.",

It offers a lot of options including vegan/vegetarian on \"Make-A-Difference-Mondays.\" There are three big dining halls throughout campus which might get crowded depending on what time you go. The food is pretty good quality, not the best, but it's good enough. There's also a food court in the GSU which offers good places to eat for dining points. Late night food is also offered and is another great way to use dining points. Starbucks is the best because it is conveniently located at SMG and you can use dining points to grab some coffee or breakfast.",

Make sure you pick a plan that offers dining points (the 250 plan worked very well for me). Here's a quick explanation: Dining points are like money, except you have to spend it on on-campus retail locations like Buick Street Market (a great mini grocery), Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Late Night Kitchen (restaurant under 100 Bay State) and even to order pizza from Dominoes or Pizza Hut. Check out bu.edu/dining to find out what other options you have - it will blow your mind! The dining hall food isn't that bad either. Except for a lack of seasoning on their meats (probably a health standard) the dining halls do quite well for themselves and have different dishes every day. Convenience points are what the title implies - convenient, but what they really are is just another way BU tries to grab for money from you. If you're paying 4.5K for a meal plan why should you spend extra money for food? Exactly, you shouldn't. So keep your hard earned money in your pocket and when the time comes to actually buy something from the \"Convenience Store\" aka on-campus mini corner store, just use your own money.",

The local pizza companies accept dining points and deliver until 3am most days of the week, and just this year a new state of the art dining hall opened along with a Jamba Juice. There are also a ridiculous amount of Starbucks' on and right off campus, along with a Dunkin Donuts that takes dining points. In case the dining hall food gets boring, there are several restaurants a few minutes off campus, such as Uburger, Chipotle, and Panera Bread.",

There were 5 last year but they got rid of the three small ones to create a giant 2 floor mega dining hall. It's the only college dining hall to have a 4 star rating! There is also a food court where there is a panda express, pinkberry, starbucks, a salad bar, a burger joint, and BU's version of Panera. With each dining plan you get an allotted amount of dining points which you can use there, and the on campus market or any of the other 5 starbucks' on campus. Local businesses including papa johns and dominos also take dining points. Simply put you will never go hungry here! There are always vegan, vegetarian, and healthy choice options as well as ethnic foods from around the world at the dining halls.",

Dining dollars will buy you Starbucks coffee, late night food, and dominos pizza--all the college essentials.The only reason they didn't get an A+ is because the plans cater more towards people who eat lots and there isn't a small plan option for girls/ light eaters. I recommend starting with the plan that offers 9 meals a week, freshman usually pick 2 a day to start with, but that is way too many and you will always end up wasting them.

This is why the mandatory (except apartment style housing) meal plan sucks because many places do not take convenience points and you end up paying out of pocket. But for those who are not on a meal plan, this is quite possibly the best place for off-campus options that are close and convenient from all residences.",

We have five dining halls that serve better than average food, where you can use meal swipes. The dining halls serve between 5 and 10 different options on an average night and even have local chefs visit and create menus. We also have an assortment of restaurants like Panda Express, Jamba Juice, sandwich, and sushi places located in our student union, which is where dining dollars can be used. Did I mention we also have 5 Starbucks on campus?",

West Campus is about a twenty minute walk from my classes, which is inconvenient, but there is a shuttle if you are lucky enough to catch it. The bathrooms are by far the worst.

For where I'm living now (Warren Towers), it is a freshman dorm so everyone here are freshman and wants to know each other and make friends, thus it is more social than probably other dorms. It is also located in the central of campus right in front of CAS, and there are numerous facilities (laundry room, study lounge, mail room...) alongside a dining hall so it is extremely convenient to get to class and get food. One downside would probably be the quality of the rooms (can remind people of a prison) and size of a room (quite small). But overall it is quite a good dorm for freshman to live in and I met some of my closest friends here. Wouldn't want to live here next year though.",

The apartments on campus are usually fine, but very hard to get into unless you know someone who lives there and that will have a vacancy. Most residences don't have air conditioning, and there have been numerous bug and mice problems. The dorms don't get cleaned on the weekends so you can only imagine the scene after a Saturday night. Freshman housing isn't as bad as people like to portray it. Warren has common rooms, but West Campus doesn't. West Campus is more social/athletic/loud, Warren is for more studious types. Sophomore housing is a disaster, and a lot of Bay State residents are a toss up; some are falling apart, some are beautiful.",

The rooms are small, but if you have an agreeable roommate that respects your space, there is enough space in the room that both roommates are happy. The social atmosphere at West campus is pretty big, on weekend nights there are almost always people talking and socializing outside the dorms. Within floors, it really depends on who is on it and how social they are. I love living on West Campus because my building is connected to the dining hall, and I'm close to Fit Rec and the other athletic facilities. I've heard Warren Towers are pretty bad, but they are very conveniently located to CAS, the largest college at BU.",

However, I know that with the cost of room an board, I could be living in a nearby apartment with my own room and a private bath. The dorm buildings are very safe and require guests to leave their IDs at the front desk. No one gets through without their IDs. My experience at west campus has been okay. The people who choose to live on this side of campus are partiers and athletes, and my floor isn't very sociable. It is also a 20 minute walk from my classes. Thankfully, I am an adaptable person and have figured out how to live with it.  I definitely won't be living here again next year, that is if I get my first choice in housing next year.",

These two options would be considered the best dorms. The worst dorm would have to be Warren Towers, not because of it's proximity to classes (it's the closest option to classes), but because it's in terrible condition, and students prefer to be close to Alston where a lot of the parties are. Lots of people move to West Campus dorms for this reason. Anywhere you live, there will be a good social atmosphere. The most costly dorms, though, are the Student Villages. For some this may be a small price to pay for luxury, but for some it may not be worth it.",

            "Review": "Housing is completely variable based on where you choose to live. The freshman year housing is either Warren or West campus and the two have different vibes. West is more of a sporty/ preppy place where people are more likely to spend the weekends off campus. Warren is definitely more of your \"classic\" college dorm, with small rooms and close floors. Theres always people around to hang out with and people hosting \"room parties\". After freshman year the options open up with most choosing to live in Towers, Hojo, or Myles standish. These are also really variable but expect that Myles is very grungy, Hojo is a bit nicer with ensuite bathrooms and air conditioning (but also quads), and Towers is cramped but in a good location. Upperclassmen tend to try and live in Stuvi which is VERY nice, but far away from classes in west, or the Brownstones, South, and the Whitestones. The Whitestone apartments are the nicest places in central campus, South has good options for apartments as well as less overbearing RAs, and the Brownstones are old but beautiful from the outside and also have pretty lax RAs. Danielson is regarded as the worst housing option due to distance from campus and lack of social atmosphere. As Boston is an older city many of the buildings are historic, so don't expect the Brown/White stones to be in perfect shape, and Myles is also a historic hotel. However the new buildings like the two student villages (and the upcoming Stuvi3) are still in near perfect condition and offer spacious living quarters.",

The dorms are small and the apartments are not much bigger, but living anywhere in a city will be like that. And unless you are in one of the freshman buildings or the super elite StuVi, the rest of the buildings are pretty quiet.

Most people, once they are in a Whitestone or apartment-style room, choose to stay there, which means its harder for the unlucky ones to find a nice place. Warren Towers is a great freshman dorm and its nice having a dining hall inside, especially during really bad winter days. Towers is more of a sophomore dorm so people are less willing to interact and the rooms are a bit larger than in Warren Towers. It's close to Bay State dining hall which is nice. Both dorms are close to central campus so its good if you're in ENG or CAS. SMG, SHA, SARG, and CGS majors may prefer west campus housing but in general, location is good. StuVi is dream housing but it's super expensive and way out in West campus which is far from most of my classes. So for me, the view is not worth it. To be honest, I just want a kitchen. Maybe Senior year...",

Housing lottery is based completely on luck, on the uphand you can appeal over the summer for the housing you actually want and often times it works out. South is actually an underrated, very nice area to live with pretty brownstones it's a nice place to get a way from campus while still being within minutes of walking distance. But, you can't ignore the fact that even the cheapest dorm option (standard double room and board) will still cost you about $1,000 a month. Eventually, it might be economically best to move off campus. Otherwise if you can afford it apartments and also StuVi are great options you should take advantage of if you can while they're available to you in college.",

The laundry facilities, mail room and in-building dining hall make it easy to live and are great when the weather is bad.  My room in particular was fine, but I have friends who have leaks in their rooms/hallways when it rains because the building is old.  Overall, it was a great place to meet other people and it is directly across the street from all of my classes (which was wonderful when I overslept and had ten minutes to make it to class on time).

Warren is a prison, but has tight-knit floors and is 30 seconds away from CAS and COM with a Starbucks, Subway, and Jamba Juice on the ground floor. Very strict security guards. West has more of a campus feel and is where most of the athletes/Greeks live but can be very far from your classes if you aren't in CGS, CFA, or SHA. The West dining hall is better and it's close to FitRec. East campus is the most beautiful area to live but also the quietest. Shelton/Kilachand (houses the Honors College and Writer's Corridor) has big rooms with bathrooms in suite and the best study rooms of any dorm but the least social life. It's across from 100 BSR, which is the best dining hall on campus by far. Towers is slightly quieter than Warren but the rooms are nicer and it's still close to class. HoJo is decent and the private bathrooms are nice but many people living there are in triples and I've heard reports of bedbugs. Danielsen is very very far from everything but the rooms are nice. Stuvi I and II are gorgeous but you will not live there unless you are willing to pay lots of money and you're an athlete/Greek/know someone who can pull you in.

I know lots of people who don't mind living in these residences and actually love it. The social atmosphere at certain dorms really depends on the kinds of people you end up living close to. Many students describe dorms such as Warren Towers to be the best option for freshman because of the amount of close friends you'll make who live on your floor, but I happened to be placed on a floor with other people who were not as sociable.",

But proximity to classes is great, and proximity to the GSU and among other places is awesome. Living on campus is fun because you get to see everyone and feel the experience of being surrounded by college students.",

I haven't found much to complain about, probably because I'm not too picky. Some of the dorms can be old. Cleanliness is really good and for the most part, the locations are great except when there's the big difference between east and west. The housing process isn't too complicated, but it's done by seniority and you can easily end up with a \"bad\" number. I haven't experienced it, but I've heard of summer swap which can help if you do end up with a bad number.",

The best social atmosphere is west campus because it's close to all of the weekend activities, but it's more expensive.
