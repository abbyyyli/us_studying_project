            "Review": "ND is a really unique community, and I think my favorite thing about it was that so many of the students there feel motivated to make a positive contribution through their careers, not just in it for the money. Campus is beautiful and super safe, and there are just a zillion ways to have fun as a student there. As a downside, definitely less diversity than some other schools, but there are a lot of ways to find your people, no matter who you are. Finding your version of ND is important: not everyone loves football, and there's a strong current that will want to sweep you up in that, but going to games is NOT the only thing to do on Saturdays. I went to like 3 games a year, and that was enough for me. Staying grounded, finding your friends, and making sure you take advantage of the academic resources available there would be my tips for success. Good luck!",

The immersion and involvement of the upperclassmen in the freshman's lives make the transition go smoother than otherwise. The amount of brotherhood formed in a mens dorm is unparralleled. If you want community and genuine connection with people in the first few weeks go to Notre Dame. One consideration is that the campus is slightly lacking in the diversity field, but that has never felt cumbersome at all. If you look, god will provide. Lastly, racism has not been an issue for me here and everyone is so welcoming no matter what culture you represent.",

In my first couple semesters, I have learned to focus on my own success and improvement instead of comparing myself to my peers. This was discussed well in our First-Year Moreau course. As a POC who is non-denominational Christian at a predominately White and Catholic institution, I deeply appreciate the separate clubs for those of us out of the majority to gather. That being said, there is definitely a lack of understanding from the majority of students as these other groups and cultures aren't promoted or integrated as much into every day activities. Leaving us to still feel as if we're on a separate island. I believe that bringing different groups together would help us understand one another more, leading to a greater sense of belonging.",

Even though there are quite a lot of students, professors and staff go out of their way to make time for students individually. I went into Japanese class as a first time learner. The language professors are especially dedicated and encouraging. I loved it to the point of making it a minor and planning to study abroad in Japan of summer 2024.

The people at Notre Dame are truly amazing. Every person I met at Notre Dame the past year, whether it was a teacher or fellow student has a special kindness to them. Everyone I met would be willing to drop what they were doing at any moment to help you if you needed the help. Consequently, at Notre Dame I felt safe and at home. I knew that the people there had my back and will help me achieve the goals I have set for myself. At Notre Dame I am not only set up to succeed career wise, but more importantly I have been impacted and set up for being a genuinely good person who is concerned about helping benefit society as a whole.",

This school has a way of bringing people together whether through random dorm/roommate assignments as first years or through various events on campus. Resources are also highly accessible with mental health services offered for free to ALL students regardless of insurance plans, as well as a specific fund for low-income students that covers necessities such as winter clothes and laptop/laptop repairs. During my time here, I have been able to find support everywhere, especially my dorm and friends groups and several scholars programs. My only complaint is that Notre Dame is located in South Bend, Indiana where it has long and very cold winters with a permacloud that never goes away. Being from Arizona however, I have learned to adjust to the weather.",

The sense of security and comfort it offers is something I really appreciate. It stinks because of the anal rules prohibiting girls and guys from visiting each other late at night. There are many regulations, but they really don't stop anyone from doing anything; they merely require that they do it quietly or in secret. The community at Notre Dame is its best feature. Upon entering the campus, you immediately feel at home. Anywhere you go, if you run into Notre Dame alumni, they'll buy you dinner, help you get a job, or even just invite you over to watch the ND football game. I adore Notre Dame's spirituality. I also appreciate how concerned the school is with the children' futures. Because it is a very safe campus with students who watch out for one another, it is very beneficial for undergraduates.",

Getting to know professors and peers beyond the three hours a week you spend in their classroom is very important.

The faculty are great being both knowledgeable in their field and respecting their students. Notre Dame is a tough school to get into and those academic standards continue to be expected once a student is admitted. For the most part, the culture of Notre Dame is good; great sporting events, impressive school spirit, longstanding traditions. But this culture lacks diversity and inclusion and is steeped in arrogance. Students mostly come from wealthy families so the investment of the high tuition costs is not too terrible for them and this spoiled attitude is definitely noticeable. Additionally, for what it costs to attend the university, there is little value outside of having 'Notre Dame' on a resume. All in all, is Notre Dame necessarily worth the hype? No, but it is a great school nonetheless.",

Everyone is super collaborative, friendly, and extremely accepting regardless of differences. The faculty is super acceptable and want to speak to you or help you with coursework when needed. People have close-knit friendships with their dorms and all partake in signature traditions. Plus the campus is awesome!",

The ND network is strong, but the pressure to be a certain kind of person while a student is strong too. There is a lack of diversity - racial, socioeconomic, and diversity of backgrounds - which means that students who do not fit within those groups have to work harder to find their way.",

The holistic and competitive academics; a year-round stunning campus; top-notch athletics; a social environment that truly lives up to the “work hard, play hard” moniker; a long list of excellent career opportunities and connections (alumni network is crucial); steeped in incredible traditions (alma mater is iconic every time) and virtuous goals; and, most importantly, unbelievable people who are intelligent and caring individuals that make me excited at the prospect of forging more bonds with them. \n\nCome to Notre Dame, you won’t regret it and go Irish.",

These dorms parallel Greek Life in many ways while being far more inclusive. Students can choose to be very involved in Dorm Life with sports teams, dances, fundraisers, and other community events.",

If you are a student looking to major in design, I would advise looking elsewhere. \n\nI was an ND graphic design student and ended up transferring because I was not being challenged in my art/design classes, and I was missing a creative community. My classmates had little passion for design which affected my motivation and the quality of instruction. The career development resources for design students are limited, and you cannot take a business/marketing unless you are enrolled in the Mendoza College of Business. This is not conducive to the art/design student who must be able to market their services and work. That being said, the instructors and staff are extremely friendly and supportive. However, the price of a Notre Dame education for an art/design student is not worth it.",

There are so many amazing things about this university— the professors who care about their students as learners and humans, the dorms that offer a supportive community that becomes home, the campus that feels too beautiful to be real. The academics were rigorous; the extracurriculars brought so much joy and lifelong friendships. I grew spiritually through campus ministry & socially through engagement with the Center for Social Concerns. The biggest thing I wish were different about ND is the diversity— they boast about inclusivity but have a long way to go to live up to that. Predominantly white and heteronormative. I encountered people (in the theatre realm, mostly) who are very different from myself & I’m so grateful for them— I wish that level of diversity (of race, sexuality, religions, political viewpoints, etc) were representative of the whole campus.",

Beyond that, I truly do not think any other school represents the complete \"college package\" quite like ND: outside of great community, we have top-notch academics, stellar athletics, world class arts programs, a beautiful campus, one of the best alumni networks in the country, incredible study abroad and research programs, an internationally recognizable brand, strong faith-based opportunities, and above all, people who genuinely care about you and want to see you succeed.

Another thing I don’t like is how isolated the campus is. You have to Uber 5 miles ($10 one way btw) just to get shampoo from the nearest Target. I have found I actually like hanging out in (as students call it) “ghetto” South Bend rather than pretentious Notre Dame.

The resources here allow students to flourish both in mind and heart. The focus on building human beings rather than just smarty pants is what distinguishes Notre Dame from the rest of the top tier pack colleges. Notre Dame professors and classes provide so much to each student due to the smaller (and therefore much better) faculty to student ratio. There is just so much opportunity waiting at each corner here at Notre Dame. While the first week (or even first year) may be a rush and leave you both mentally and socially spent, it'll easily bear its fruit as you come to see Notre Dame as the second home it is.",

The varsity sports provide entertainment year-round.\n\nGo to Notre Dame if you're looking for more than just a high salary to show for your postsecondary studies–and if you don't mind a spring semester that feels more like winter.

One of the major things that the University definitely lacks though is diversity, and of literally every sort. Whether it be race, political views, socioeconomic status, or religion, Notre Dame does a really poor job of developing a more diverse student body. \nIn all though, the University does maintain a great academic record and provides pretty good financial help, while also offering an engaging athletic program that helps enrich the school.",

I've already found some solid friends with whom I enjoy spending these cold (and warm) Indiana days. ND meets 100% of financial need; this assistance extends beyond tuition and has allowed me to get the full Notre Dame Experience. Everyone here is passionate about something, and one passion we all share is a love for Notre Dame, Our Mother. Go Irish!",

No greek life, but the single-sex dorm culture is arguably better -- it holds many of the pros of Frats/Sororities without the pressures of rushing. School pride and interest in athletics is huge. \n\nBut overall, what makes Notre Dame excellent is the people. Notre Dame doesn't accept simply the smartest of the smart.

So, students typically remain in their dorms that they are randomly placed in for all four years.  This dorm becomes a family for every student, and the dorms each have an identity.  For example, my dorm, Howard Hall, is represented by a duck mascot.  We build community through weekly meetings in our \"pond\", intimate weekly masses in our dorm's chapel, and service events unique to our dorm.  In addition to the incredible dorm life at Notre Dame, I have been blessed to be a part of the Band of The Fighting Irish as a saxophone player.  There is no feeling quite like marching through the tunnel to 80,000 cheering fans on every game day Saturday.  The friendships that I have made through band have been life changing for me.  I am truly so proud to be a part of this group, a group that is greater than myself, and I am so thankful.",

It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts. Although science is still good here and people get into great grad programs no matter what they want to continue on studying!",

Not only are my professors well-qualified and really care about their students, but the other students care about me too. Especially in the college of engineering, we work together to get things done, just like I have in my internship. Campus is beautiful and safe, and I get to live across the hall with all of my best friends.",

            "Review": "Notre Dame is a very unique university. The campus is beautiful and there are so many fantastic opportunities for its students, but it takes a certain type to go here. ND does lack diversity; it isn't non-existent, but it is not the school's strongest aspect. While this may seem stifling to some more adventurous types, I've found many genuinely good friends there, of multiple races and genders. You have to remember that this is a Catholic university, so there are certain limitations to that. The dorms aren't co-ed and there isn't Greek life. The dorms almost become sororities and fraternities, which you can choose to involve yourself in to the degree that you want. The guys dorms are a lot more lax on the rules than girls dorms, which is unfair, but we make it work. There are almost always dorm parties or off-campus house parties on the weekends. While ND is a very academic/nerdy school, we still know how to be social. And of course, football is integral to ND life!",

I loved that the campus was small enough that you can get to pretty much everything pretty easily. The campus is beautiful. There were so many opportunities to get involved, whether it be through student groups, research, work, volunteering. Many of the students had similar values as me and it was very easy to make friends. The dorms really facilitated this as well. I did not like that there were double standards as far as enforcing rules in women's vs. men's dorms.",

People generally grow pretty attached to their dorm and the people they live with. There is a huge sense of pride and family within each dorm and from my experience this dorm lifestyle sort of provided a surrogate Greek Life without having to apply or rush. Personally, this Greek Life-esque community in the absence of an Greek system was one of the things that attracted me to Notre Dame. It's got the connections and family feel without having to be accepted. You are already \"accepted\" and don't have to prove anything to anyone.",

            "Review": "School spirit is high at Notre Dame. This is most evident in regard to football, but it applies to other sports as well and the student body in general. Even if you don't like sports, you can participate in the social aspect of football gamedays. Most students buy season ticket packages and go to all of the home football games, but there are some who don't. Generally, people love football season, but it does take away an entire day of the weekend that could have been used to study or do homework, so it can be difficult to balance football and studies. \r\n\r\nIntramurals are also very popular. The student body here is very athletic, and many students play on intramural teams for their dorms or co-rec teams with their friends. A wide variety of sports are offered, and some I had never even heard of before coming to Notre Dame, such as broomball. We even have sports like curling, bowling, and racquetball, in addition to more popular sports like football, basketball, soccer, volleyball, and lacrosse.\r\n\r\nOne thing Notre Dame could improve (and is currently in the process of improving) is the gym/workout facilities for general students. For being such an athletically inclined student body, the resources are sometimes inadequate to meet the demand. For example, it can often be difficult to get a treadmill, especially during the spring, when people are training for the Holy Half Marathon. The Campus Crossroads project is aimed at making the football stadium into a student center with classrooms and athletic facilities, so hopefully this problem will be solved soon.",

This is strictly enforced. Regarding alcohol, everyone knows people are drinking, and it's accepted. None of the hall staff is out to get underage drinkers or anything like that. However, there is a STRICT no drug policy.",

Athletes get to live with everyone else in the dorms, and they get special (usually better) dining hall food, free Under Armor backpacks, and a personal nutritionist. There is a lot of time commitment to the sport, but most would say it's worth it for the love of the sport. As far as student involvement, students mostly support the football, basketball, and hockey teams. And our school spirit...is that even a question? Go Irish!",

First of all there is no greek life but that usually leads to a sense of brotherhood within all the dorms, one in which you don't have to be tested or hazed to get in to. There is no co-ed housing and we do have parietals. During the weekends we are allowed to have parties in the dorms as long as the host takes full responsibility for making sure guests don't get out of control and aren't put in danger. Alcohol is allowed, well beer is allowed for those who are of legal age. Liquor is not allowed at all, if someone is caught with liquor they will be fined. \r\n\r\nAs I said Notre Dame does gives us some freedom, however I think as college students we feel the need to party and get crazy sometimes.

There are many cultural productions, such as Asian Allure and Latin Expressions, that help to share different cultures that students might not normally experience.\r\n\r\nCampus isn't very political, unless you count the occasional Viewpoint (newspaper opinion section) Wars that occasionally ignite.  80% of students are Catholic, but there is no pressure whatsoever to participate in religious life if you do not want to.",

Everyone is friendly and intelligent. A lot of people kind of look and act the same, but if you are into the preppy, put together look then you are set. If you are looking for hipsters or activists, ND isn't really the right place for you. People are very main stream. Also, most people are very involved in community service and business clubs.",

Given that they are pretty strict, people regularly break the parietals rules and the RAs are fine with it, especially in the guys' dorms. The RAs aren't trying to get you in trouble, but if your door is open at 3 AM and you have guys and girls in there, you will most definitely get in trouble. Basically with parietals, don't be stupid about it. Most people drink on campus. The guys dorms are very relaxed about alcohol and often host dorm parties. Girls dorms are way way more strict. It is not an issue if you have alcohol in your room or if you are drinking with a couple people, but don't have a party in a girls dorm.",

The intramural sports and dorm sports are super relaxed and  low commitment. On the other hand, club sports can get very intense; it depends mostly on the sport. As far as varsity sports, almost all the athletes are recruits. It is pretty hard to walk on to any of the varsity sports, but I do know people that have done it. Good luck if you are trying to walk on! Football is by far the most watched sport. Some professors let students out early on Fridays of football weekend. The campus is packed on football weekends. Everyone is super spirited! Football weekends are my favorite part of ND. Don't worry if you don't know anything about football; you will love it by the time you graduate. Everyone attends the games and the tailgates. It is a ton of fun!",

            "Review": "Most people you meet are Christian. Religiously, I would say that the diversity is poor at Notre Dame. That being said, I am not very religious and I don't feel pressured to go to church or engage in religious events. If you are religious, there is a lot for you to do though. If you are not Christian, you might find the Christian aspect overwhelming, but the students are very respectful of other religions. I am sure you can find a bunch of religious sects within South Bend, so I wouldn't worry too much. \r\n\r\nRacially, Notre Dame was way more diverse than I expected. I thought it was basically going to be all white. I was very wrong about this. There are Asians, Hispanics, African Americans and more. I have a friend from Ecuador and another from South Sudan. People really do come from all over the US and all over the world. \r\n\r\nAs far as socioeconomic aspects, I would say most people are middle class or upper class, but there is a fair share of lower class people as well. Since there aren't many things that people spend a lot of money at ND, people don't really notice what each other's financial situation is. Your economic background is not something to really worry about. \r\n\r\nPolitically, almost everyone is conservative, but people are pretty democratic on social issues. The university is way more conservative on social matters than the student body. \r\n\r\nTo address sexual orientation, I know plenty of gay and lesbian people on campus. People are accepting and the administration makes efforts to build a community for gay/lesbian/transgender students. My roommate was lesbian and she is one of the coolest people I met on campus.",

Interhall (our version of intermural sports) is something that everyone can be involved in, and many people continue to play the sports they did in high school here.

Whether it be football, hockey, basketball or any other sport, the ND students will be there cheering on the Fighting Irish. People here are VERY into ND Football and if you don't like football when you get here, you will after your first home game. Student tickets are free for a lot of sports, but you can also get season tickets to many sports for a reasonable fee (which often includes a Leprechaun Legion t-shirt). ND has a lot of tradition -- this year we celebrate our 125th year of football! It is a guarantee that some of your friends and dorm mates will be student athletes. There are no on-campus residences dedicated to athletes, so they are entirely integrated into the rest of the student body. Most of our teams are pretty competitive and Division I. Intramurals and Interhall sports are also huge. Flag football is popular for girls in the Fall. ND athletics are basically just awesome.",

Both have have certain hours known as parietals when the opposite sex are allowed to visit.  In a boys dorm, one can break parietals, if careful, and the RA's will typically chose to simply ignore it.  In a girls dorm, an RA will check the room, and if she catches you, she will report you to the rector.  A girl may be thrown out of her dorm and have to move to another dorm, or even be kicked off campus.  \r\n\r\nCampus is not dry at all, and alcohol can be found anywhere you go.  Again, in a girls dorm, it has to be kept pretty quiet.  In a boys dorm, it is completely ok to have beer in your room as long as it doesnt end up in the hallways.  Drinking games and kegs aren't allowed (doesn't mean they can't be found though).  Hard alcohol is not allowed on campus, but in certain boys dorms, you can get away with having it as long as you don't leave handles sitting out. \r\n\r\nRegarding drug use, if you are caught smoking or in the possession of any drugs, you are automatically expelled from the university.  It does not matter if you test positive or not.  They have an absolute no tolerance policy.",

This is obviously going to attract a very narrow range of students and backgrounds, with similar values instilled within them before arriving to the university and, thus, most of the students coming from families that have similar work ethics and so on. But, although the university strives to attract academic and Catholic students, it also reaches out to other backgrounds and achieves this goal, to an extent. I am friends with many international students, those of different sexual orientations and even religious beliefs, despite what people might think of the diversity within that particular demographic. But, although there is diversity, it is not obvious if you do not, for the most part, actively seek out diversity. I am already a minority in a respect at the university, as I am Protestant, so I am aware of the diversity religiously on campus, and the university offers a lot in the way of promoting diversity, whether it be religious, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, etc.",

While there is supposedly zero tolerance for drugs and parietals are strictly enforced, most students (myself included) don't mind. Most of us frown upon drug use anyway and like how parietals quiet down the dorms to allow everyone to sleep. (This is especially important in men's dorms where all of the parties are.) The alcohol policy, however, is quite lenient. The consequences of breaking the rules are fairly minor and are not always enforced. Parties can be held in men's dorms as long as they aren't out of control and no one is in danger of being hurt. In summary, be safe and relatively discreet and you should be fine. One final thing to note is that the RAs are more like friends/mentors than authority figures. While they do what is necessary to keep the students safe, they are considered friends by almost all of the students.",

In fact, a lot of us are jocks, and have lots of other interests as well. Professors recognize our intelligence, and therefore demand a lot from us, but they give us a lot of support and will definitely get to know you if you approach them, no matter what the class size. The biggest size is probably about 450 students, but there are only a couple that are like that (intro to engineering, chem 101, etc). Class size doesn't matter much if you go to office hours. That being said, the average size is definitely higher than a tiny liberal arts school, though. Once you get your gen eds out of the way, classes can be pretty darn intimate. Last semester, as a second semester freshman trying to finish up gen eds, I had three classes of about 80 students, one with 40, one with 20, and one with 10. So it really varies. The professors are pretty awesome, too. Don't come to ND if you don't want to work hard, though. Career planning is also stressed a lot here.",

I'm in the Mendoza College of Business, which has been repeatedly voted the best business school in the country. It's a great program and the professors are very knowledgeable and friendly. The business school especially provides a lot of support for beginning a career. The classes are a little boring, because business is just that way sometimes, but it's easy to like the people and enjoy your major. Business majors are generally less difficult than the very popular pre-med track and the not-so-popular engineering and architecture majors.

The First Year of Studies program gives you a taste of many departments and helps you to figure out what you are passionate about studying. The professors here are brilliant scholars and wonderful people. They make themselves readily available to help with research, to answer questions and even just to chat. They are extremely supportive and dedicated to undergraduate teaching (not just the graduate students!). It is such a luxury to have professors who are world-class experts in their fields during your first semester. Learning resources, such as the Writing Center, can be a huge aid when you are first adjusting to college and beyond. As a freshman, you will take a good mix of classes and have classes of various sizes. I have everything from 15 person seminars to 100 person lectures. This helps you to become a well-rounded college student. Coursework here is challenging, but there are enough resources to help you succeed in each and every class. There is no way for you to \"get lost\" in a course, unless it's by your own doing. Your advisors, TAs and professors are all interested in your success.

It has a good idea behind it, but there needs to be major changes, like its ability to override the departments at the school, and their inability to change schedules for needs. The different schools at Notre Dame do a much better job of acting for the students, not just what is most efficient.",

There is money available for every venture imaginable, one just needs to reach out and take advantage of what's offered.

Professors and other students are there to help you succeed and there are plenty of opportunities to do well. Class difficulty seems to vary greatly depending on the program you are in, but every student is required to take seminar classes, which are small and discussion based (and they also require attendance).

Students get free bus passes, but the buses are never on time, only make a few direct stops, do not have electronic signs to inform you when they are coming or delays (well, what do  you expect?), and run every hour or so. Extremely inefficient and backwards (obviously there are no subways or anything like that). Other than that, there is only Eddy St. within walking distance. You can take the taxis, but obviously it gets expensive for a college student after a while. If you're the type of person who likes to get off-campus sometimes to get away from the bubble, it might be a good idea to befriend someone with a car or bring your own.",

August, September, and most of October are okay, but after that, until April or even May, there is very often a lot of snow and precipitation, being so close to Lake Michigan. Students have often referred to campus as having a \"perma-cloud.\" The walk to classes is never longer than 15-20 mins, though, and ND is a really awesome place regardless.

There are drunk buses to bars that are free for students and 1$ for others. There is also a shuttle to and from St. Marys, a bus to and from Chicago, and a bus that is free for students and goes all around South Bend. Zip Cars are also available and very nice but make sure to book in advance as well.",

There are also taxis which can be a pain, but at night on the weekends they are only $3 a person which is nice. Also they have zipcars which are really convenient for anyone who doesn't have a car. Airport is 15 mins away and it also has the greyhound station and train station. Also, campus has a bus every two hours that goes to Chicago airports and SBN which is pretty cheap",

The printing system is good beacuse you can print from any computer on campus and pick your document up at any printer. It is definitely a good idea to bring your own laptop because so many assignments are online, but a personal printer is not needed.",

That is primarily because South Bend traditionally has Notre Dame to offer and that's it. While certainly far from a bustling city, I find South Bend to possess everything a college town needs. There is a large mall practically within walking distance, countless strip malls with public transportation, Rocco's pizza place, 2 movie theatres, a small zoo, and the College Football Hall of Fame. South Bend is certainly far from a tourist destination, but it has more than Notre Dame would ever need- pretty much all you need can be found within the golden gates of the university itself.",

However, if you ever get restless or need to go and get a halloween costume or get Christmas lights, there is a Wal Mart just 5 minutes away by taxi or upperclassman. Eddy Street is also a great place to go if you get tired of the dining hall. There is a Chipotle, Five Guys, McAllister's, Hot Box Pizza, and an ice cream shop just ten minutes away by foot. Finally, the College Football Hall of Fame is about ten minutes away by car. It is worth going to sometime during your 4 years at Notre Dame. *For when you're 21... Yes, there are numerous bars to go to in South Bend and a bus that drives all night from campus and back.*",

The tricky thing is that the bus, if not express to Chicago takes a good amount of time, while the train (the South Shore Line) doesn't have enough departure or arrival times to always be an option for travel. The South Bend Airport does have a reputation of having flights (especially United) get canceled from Chicago, but if you're coming in good weather, you shouldn't have an issue, and the airport is 10 minutes from campus.",

The Notre Dame football program has tradition unlike any other program in the nation. \r\nSnow: Although the weather is one of the favorite topics of complaint on campus, one of my favorite events occurs on campus after the first big snow. The entire campus meets up on south quad and there is a North vs. South quad snowball fight from midnight until whenever everyone leaves. \r\nSingle-sex dorms: Yes, we have all-girl and all-guy dorms. Most people seem to actually like this feature of campus, as do I. It's nice to be able to walk down the hall in your towel and not see that guy who lives next door, and the lack of nasty smelling hallways is a definite plus. Another common complaint about campus life is \"parietals,\" which are hours at which you have to leave the opposite sex's dorm (midnight on weekdays and 2am Fridays and Saturdays). This can be annoying at times, but it's also really nice when your roommate has a boyfriend or girlfriend. You just say \"parietals in two minutes\" and they have no excuse to stay. Granted, if your roommate is nice enough or you have a single, it's easy enough to break parietals and stay over night. \r\nOverall: Notre Dame has some unique features, but I'm a fan of all of these features, and I wouldn't change anything about this amazing university.",

According to the financial aid officers, a portion of the financial aid package is dependent on merit and academic success. However, if you don't qualify for financial aid, they will not give you any scholarships.

It's a little comical, but in reality, it's not that over the top. On College Prowler, the school is rated very well for it's food, and it deserves its good grade. The food in the dining halls IS cafeteria food, but don't think mystery meat or week-old mashed potatoes. It is not homemade, but it is very good cafeteria food. Think choose-your-own-meat-and-vegetables-and-sauces (they cook it for you) stir fry and pasta stir fry bars, think omelet bars during brunch, texmex, mediterranean, italian, american, and southern, all served at each meal. Lots of fruit, but never strawberries from some reason. Deserts, steamed veggies, deli sandwich bars. They only have two dining halls, but they're very big and they have it all. You can have it all too--- it's buffet style, all you can eat. I hardly ever feel bored, and I'm a picky eater! You just gotta be a little creative sometimes. We also have grab'n'go, where you can use your meal plan swipes if you don't have time to sit down for a meal but don't want to use flex dollars. You can use flex dollars, too, at Starbucks, Subway, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, the convenience store, and this place called Reckers which has really good pizza. Some places never close so there's always something good to eat!",

South dining hall is beautiful, exactly like Hogwarts. North is more modern. Both serve pretty much the same food, so really which dining hall you choose just depends where your dorm is. There are also cafes in most buildings, which are pretty good! I really like the cafe in Decio, O'shag, and the Law school building. Subway is also a convenient option, located in La Fortune. Also, Eddy Street Commons, right off campus, have Chipotle, Hot Box, Five Guys, etc.",

South Dining Hall is very architecturally beautiful and homey (it looks like it could fit in with Hogwarts), but North is closer to my dorm. At North, I frequent the oriental stirfry and salad bars, and find that the quality of meats and vegetables are generally high. There are many beverage options, including frozen fruit juice and a small variety of coffees and teas.\r\n\r\n I am one of the few students who signed up for three meals per day, seven meals per week. Most students choose two meals per day and around $375 in \"Flex Points\", which can be used for Subway, Burger King, convenience items and foods, Starbucks, etc. I find that the option to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner gives me plenty of healthy choices. A sample day would be: bacon, milk and coffee, and fruit in the morning; stir fry (with beef, chicken, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, and bok choi, all smothered in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and soy sauce) for lunch; and turkey, grilled lemon salmon, and a big salad for dinner.

Our system essentially replaces Greek life because students tend to live in the same dorm for all four years and form a great community within them.  We have interhall sports and other competitions, and we really love them.  My dorm is nice.  It is rather small, but it has recently been renovated, so it is pretty up to date.  However, we do not have elevators, air conditioning, or handicap accessible entries.  It is also one of the farthest dorms from most other buildings on campus, so it can take quite a while to get places.  As much as I love my hall, I would say that we are somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to quality, though I would never switch dorms unless I had to.  Another great thing about the dorms is that we each have a chapel and we can attend Mass in our dorms at least twice a week.",

Your best bets are the new dorms, like Duncan(male) and Ryan(female), which are relatively close to all class buildings. Mod Quad, on the northeast end of campus, is a relatively new area too, but it is so far from the rest of campus. Each dorm has its own reputation, events, mascots, etc., and dorm pride is a real thing. Dorms tease each other a lot, i.e. in the Keenan Revue or on ND Crushes or Yik Yak. The dorm system is often compared to Greek life, but the really nice thing is there's no rushing or hazing: you automatically belong. A couple things to keep in mind, though, are that all freshman roommates and dorms are randomly assigned, and there are community bathrooms, if that is a factor in your decision.",

A lot of students move off campus for senior year. Since there is no survey for housing placement, some people don't like their roommates freshman year, but you can pick your roommate for sophomore year. I think that the random selection system actually ends up working for most people. There is a lot of dorm pride and each dorm is definitely its own community. The dorms are clean and are overall nice. Some dorms have bigger rooms than others. Some have air conditioning and some don't (air conditioning is only an issue the first two weeks of school). Some are big and some are small. My main complaint is the strictness. A rector will write you up if she sees you drunk or with alcohol; this is mainly a concern in the girls' dorms. Guys' dorms are a lot more relaxed. The other issue is parietals.

            "Review": "The campus is full of students who attended same-sex private high schools, and many of them have lived fairly sheltered lives before coming to college.  The gender relations are already extremely weird, and separating the girls from the boys only makes it more so.  I would much rather talk to a person of the opposite sex because he was my neighbor than have to deal with the tensions between the genders.",

There are brand new town houses located just off campus that are cheap, and parking is easily available at school. Many students however, prefer to stay on campus, to stay close to their Notre Dame community.",

There are also plenty of student houses in residential areas for fairly cheap, although some can be in some-what shady areas. I would say overall the off-campus options are very adequate for demand.",

Halls are single-sex and rivalries are intense. A lot of people enjoy the feeling of camaraderie that comes along with hall life, but I guess I'm just bitter.",
