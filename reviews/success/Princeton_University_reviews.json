I would say it is significantly more rigorous than similar academic institutions (e.g., Harvard), however, I find that it really challenges you to explore subjects very deeply. I did enjoy the eating club culture since it allowed you to engage with those who you otherwise might not have.",

The academic workload has pushed me to think critically, especially in computer science. Collaborating with brilliant peers has opened my mind to new perspectives. Outside the classroom, the supportive campus community offers many clubs and activities, allowing me to connect with others who share my passion for technology and leadership. Princetonâ€™s focus on excellence and innovation inspires me to set high goals. Overall, my first year has been a whirlwind of academic challenges, personal growth, and meaningful connections, shaping my journey as both a student and an individual.",

It attracts students who hold themselves to high standards which, due to grade deflation, adds to the stress of most students. The campus is beautiful in the more historic part of campus. The newer buildings are very clean and there are several food options. I donâ€™t ever feel the need to snack with the amount of options I have in the undergraduate meal plan. Many of the student organizations are wonderful and everyone is very passionate about their field. It is certainly not an athletic school but alumni are extremely passionate about Princeton pride.",

There were so many opportunities to become involved on campus, especially in the many music groups (accapella, synphohnia, etc.). There are also so many opportunities to become involved in service through the Pace Center for Civic engagement. The one issue I have is that there are too many things to do and not enough time! The courses here are no joke, and they take up a huge chunk of your time, so I would definitely prepare to be spending a lot of time studying and working on assignments. The academic semesters here are also relatively short (12 weeks), which sometimes makes it difficult to keep up with work. That being said, I am spending my summer on campus and having an incredible time. Finally, I think the accessibility of professors at Princeton is really amazing. They are always willing to meet one-on-one, and they have many office hours (especially in intro-level courses) to help students prepare for exams.",

Yet students leave the courses having minimal actual grasp of the content. Because so much is expected for weekly assignments, actual learning is very little.\n\nThe social dynamics are terrible. Students who know one another ignore eachother when walking past eachother. I was laughed at by a group of girls for saying hello. Students have no loyalty to one another.

Much of the coursework will not prepare you for graduate programs. \n\nDespite doing academically well, I felt that my quality of life suffered in comparison to equally credible institutions due to an incompetent administration. I do not think that the university is a safe place. If you have a choice with another top institution, go elsewhere. The \"name\" wasn't worth it as a student or as an alumni- assuming you have a choice of another top university.",

The University truly offers a high quality education, especially as a result of its wonderful professors, some of which are Nobel Laureates. Moreover, the University's network allows for extensive connection between current and graduated students. This leads to great opportunities that would not necessarily be available elsewhere. Lastly, I really believe the Bridge Year program instills a humble nature in students through introducing the opportunity to volunteer for a year abroad. Doing so allows students to mature and experience other cultures prior to embarking on a difficult, yet rewarding task of attending Princeton University.",

No matter where you went to high school, no matter how hard you worked, no matter how smart you are, you're going to be working really hard, and there aren't really any \"paths of least resistance.\"\n\nThat being said, Princeton is an incredible place, and probably the best undergraduate education in the country.  There is no where else where you have even nearly as much access to nobel laureates, successful businesspeople, famous lecturers or general funding as you do at Princeton.\n\nAs far as the student body, they work hard and play hard.  Everyone has a lot of work, but the students really do like to have a good time, be that through engagement in extracurricular activities or a party at one of the eating clubs.\n\nI would do it all over again, and easily would make the same decision.",

One of the best things the school has provided me with and one of the major reason's I chose it is because of its financial aid package, and the financial support it gives students in whatever endeavor you wish to pursue. Princeton has renowned professors, classes are rigorous but rewarding, the campus is beautiful and the food is excellent. On the other hand, one of the things that has frustrated me is that selectivity seems to be the rule of the game on campus beyond academics - whether its for extracurriculars which often have application processes, or socially with eating clubs. However, it is the best school in the country for a reason.",

Princeton is a great school but what really helped me choose this school over others was their great financial aid package. I also enjoy how Princeton feels like the best of both worlds in a way. If you like a suburban sprawling campus with a heavy focus on undergraduates (seriously, sorry potential grad students) then Princeton is definitely unique, especially when it comes to other Ivies and equally competitive universities. I like that I don't feel overshadowed by a renowned graduate school. I like that I can see new people every day but I can also recognize faces in Frist. There are things that Princeton should work on: like economic diversity (or at the least, addressing it), spiffing up cultural understanding amongst the student body and frankly changing the entire finals schedule but overall, Princeton is a pretty cool place.",

In most of my seminars, there was a fair representation of students of color. That being said, there are still cases of intolerance that have become apparent after such incidents as Ferguson. Politically, Princeton seems to be a bit split. There's only a small portion of people that seem particularly interested in politics but those that are can find their niche in either major political ideology. Religion isn't a major major part of campus but if you're religious, there are ways to get involved. There are students who make that a big part of their campus experience. Sexual orientation is also something that seems pretty acceptable here. In terms of economic background, I think that's the most taboo thing of all. While there are several students who come from lower-income families, Princeton as a whole doesn't really address differences in lifestyles. There are several (more) students of privilege here and if you're not one of those students, it could be easy to feel left out in some ways.",

Unless you are in substance-free housing, it is typically okay to have alcohol in your dorm. As far as underage drinking goes, you only have to be 18 to get into the Eating Clubs, and from there they don't ID anyone for beer. Even if someone underage gets drunk and has to go to McCosh (the clinic on campus), they don't punish them for being underage. They want people to feel comfortable getting professional help when drunk rather than being afraid of the consequences of being underaged and risking major health issues.",

Therefore nobody gets in trouble for drinking if you have to call the ambulance for a severely drunk friend.  The only thing Princeton is really strict about is cheating.  We all sign an honor code and its a big source of pride that students follow it and also report any student that is not abiding by it.

I quickly realised that my high school did not give me adequate preparation for my major; just basic college success. Now that I look back, I know that I should have spent this year on the two basic music courses and then proceeded further. (If any of you are wondering, MUS 103 and 104 are the simpler, more basic classes; MUS 105 and 106 are the prerequisites for majoring in music).\r\nMy hope was to become skilled in songwriting and composition, but you have to have adequate experience before entering the field here. (Not just in courses, but even performance ensembles, as well.)\r\nRight now, I'm not as concerned about finding a job as I am with developing my skills.",

But if you want to be an engineer, or are even considering an engineering major, make sure you are in the BSE program, or at least taking the prerequisites the very first semester.

If you are not the top 5% (and its really hard to be there even if you are hard working, interested, and ambitious simply because you are in a tough pool at Princeton) you don't exist.  We might have world renown faculty but for some of them you need to sign up weeks in advance to get an office hours appointment.  Many are absolute experts in their field and have no idea how to communicate that knowledge to fresh undergrads.  Some are just eccentric and others cocky. A few are genuinely nice and interested in your progress and growth.  When you find these do all you can to keep in touch with them.

Their computers also work better. In the Whitman Library, computers sometimes freeze up while I'm trying to print.",

The town is quite small, however, and the square contains a good number of expensive, high-end stores, which does not always fit each \"starving college student's\" budget. There are some amazing historical sites on and around the campus, which is great for times when friends and family visit. Princeton's area is extremely safe. Being a small town that is quite secluded from the rest of New Jersey, there is very little crime in the area. There are world-famous restaurants and eateries here and there, so it's not as if you have few good options when taking out friends. Despite the fact that there may not be the lively vibe of a big city, Princeton's location is perfectly ideal because it sits right in between New York City and Philadelphia, 55 miles in both directions. Say you wanted to go shopping in Manhattan or attend a broadway show, you can hop on a train and be in the city in less than 1.5 hours. It's amazing!",

Though Princeton students are often fixed on and around campus it's easy to see why. The surroundings provide students with food and (flagrantly expensive) clothing and a soupcon of amusement. On campus there are always intramural leagues playing, artistic groups meeting and cultural co-mingling. In fact, in can be hard to duck out from the legions of clubs and events.

In my opinion, they all have their own styles. The biggest ones -Rocky/Mathey & Wilcox/Wu- are arguably the best because...well, they're bigger and offer more options.  That's not to say that all the food is great -it's not. There are definitely bad days. The meal plans are pretty nice but aren't really very useable for food off campus. Late Meal at Princeton is great for underclassmen who have an unlimited meal plan (and it's arguably better than the food in the residential colleges) and many students utilize it.

            "Review": "The living situation is okay depending on which residential college you draw into. Butler/Wilson is probably the best location as far as freshman and sophomore dorms go. It's probably the closest to academic buildings. Whitman isn't bad either. Butler is extremely modern. Whitman was built most recently, but it has a pseudo-gothic look. During the day, if you don't keep your light on, especially if you have a single, your room will feel very small and dark. Forbes is beautiful, but it's really far from everything. (I left out Rocky/Mathey because I never lived there). As a freshman and sophomore, regardless of where you live, you will be subjected to sharing a dorm with all people of your chosen gender who live on your floor. Fortunately, if you draw well, upperclass housing will be quite palatable. I don't know what the best option is, but if you know you will be an engineering major, rethink drawing into Forbes because it is the furthest away from the E-Quad. However, if you want to live in one of the best-looking dorms, choose Forbes. The social atmosphere in the residential colleges is good if you are an outgoing person. We have study breaks once a week for the whole community, and College Night on Tuesdays. You will survive these much easier if you have friends who live in your residential college (for me, that's Whitman. If you want one night every couple of weeks to have dinner with students who are only in your residential college, then Whitman is for you). In order to choose housing, you are assigned a specific lottery time. Log in to the housing website at that time and watch in real time as other students make their decisions as well..",
