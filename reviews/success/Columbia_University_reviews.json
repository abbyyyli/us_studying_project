            "Review": "Columbia University is not for the faint-hearted. It is incredibly trying and it is easy to get lost in the flood of excellence. The people are what make it: your friends, the professors and TAs you create bonds with. I took both Economics and Visual Arts classes. The Economics classes were competitive and large, the professors impersonal. I absolutely loved my Visual Arts classes however. All my professors were talented, friendly, passionate professionals actively working in their fields. The art school facilities were wonderful too. The administration is were a lot of Columbia's problems stem from, but on an individual level, once you find your footing, you'll have a great time.",

It offers a wealth of opportunities in both social and academic spheres, making it an attractive choice for students seeking a rigorous education in a vibrant urban setting. However, the high cost of tuition and living expenses can be a significant drawback. Additionally, some students find professors less accessible, and safety on campus remains a concern. Despite these challenges, Columbia provides unparalleled resources and networking opportunities for those who can navigate its demanding environment.",

The professors are very understanding and approachable, which makes even the most challenging courses enjoyable and engaging.

Moreover, departmental and administrative politics tends to limit the amount of support undergraduate students receive from their major department and/or the college as a whole. Overall, I would recommend that you find the enclaves that you feel supported and can engage with the subjects that interest you the most.",

The classes are well-structured, interesting, and highly applicable to real-world business scenarios. The curriculum is thoughtfully designed, strongly emphasizing developing strategic thinking and effective communication skills that are directly transferable to the workplace.\n\nThat said, I feel there is room for improvement in fostering a stronger sense of community outside the classroom. More engagement activities like networking events, workshops, or casual mingling opportunities would greatly enhance the overall experience. Such initiatives could provide students with a chance to build meaningful connections across different programs and broaden their professional networks.",

First off, they need to control the current on-campus protests. I understand the position, but it's disrupting class. So much so, that the job I have lined up is telling me that I might have to take additional classes so I am prepared. You will have to make boatloads of money to pay the loans of - no one ever talks about that. Many of my friends are going off to law or medical school but they also seem to wish they had saved up their money for law or medical school. I grew up in Brooklyn and there's no place I'd rather be than NYC but it's changed so much in the past year. It's going through a rough patch. I realize the city always comes back but something to consider. My twin sister is happy at Syracuse and received practically a full ride and is going to medical school next year. I am wondering about my experience here.",

The program emphasizes swift movement from thought to action and offers opportunities for broadening one's worldview through new interactions. They bring in relevant and contemporary speakers to further push the discourse on design and its abilities. The studios are equipped with the faculty at the top of their field.  Minor improvements could be made in the organization of classes and the distribution of scholarships and assistantships.

The faculty is world-class, but I'd recommend that as an undergraduate, you steer a little clear of classes led by graduate students and focus on seminars with established, prolific professors which is where I've found the most value. I'd love to see Columbia emphasize and uplift the humanities just as it uplifts STEM, moving forward.",

The urban backdrop weaves itself into the university life, creating a unique mix of academia and real-world exposure. From challenging courses led by world-class faculty to a diverse array of student clubs and organizations, there’s no shortage of opportunities for intellectual growth and personal development.\n\nMy favorite aspect of Columbia is its deep commitment to academic rigor. Courses are challenging but rewarding, with professors who are not just experts in their fields, but also dedicated mentors. The university’s Core Curriculum stands out, offering a broad, well-rounded foundation in various disciplines, and instilling a valuable ability to approach problems from different angles.\n\nThe student body’s diversity is another strong point. With students from all corners of the globe, you’re exposed to a variety of perspectives and, cultures.",

Objectively, pretty terrible undergrad experience (I came in as a transfer from another Ivy) - no school spirit, toxic overly competitive school culture prioritizing grades over learning/socialization, non-existent party scene. Alumni network is much weaker than peer schools, as hating Columbia is the most Columbia thing imaginable. However, the academics are top-notch, although you will likely struggle to maintain a good school-life balance. A lot of CU's flaws are common to all big city schools; as someone who previously studied on an isolated rural campus, those liberal arts schools will generally have a stronger student experience and alumni network compared to somewhere like Columbia, NYU, UCLA etc.",

However, I do feel that there can be many improvements to my experience at Columbia. One of the difficulties that faces Columbia is how overcrowded shared spaces become. The dining halls, the libraries, and even the dorm hall bathrooms can be terrible experiences due to the high amount of students that consistently frequent these spots. Seeing long lines at the dining hall, not being able to find a seat at the library, and constantly dealing with dirty bathrooms given the number of students per bathroom in the dorm halls has a long-term impact on students after some time. In addition, it feels particularly difficult at times to make friends at Columbia. The orientation program at the beginning of the year does a poor job in building community, and there are not many opportunities to meet new people.",

All though the degree is one of the best, the school itself has a lot of flaws.

This school is really not worth an almost six-figure tuition. The professors for core classes don't seem to care about the students much, especially in SEAS (the engineering school). STEM classes are very much \"figure it out yourself\" versus a hands-on, collaborative, and educational experience. The culture is extremely competitive and if you're looking for a traditional, American college experience with FUN, don't come here. I wanted to give the \"Party Scene\" rating a 2 for the on-campus functions, however, Columbia saves itself via its prime location in Manhattan. There's always a party somewhere on this island. That is the one saving grace I'll give this school.",

In terms of food, they tout having a huge range of vegetarian and vegan options but often offer pasta and steamed vegetables. Sometimes they have great options, but it is just a once-in-a-blue-moon occasion. Recently, the dining halls have added new stations and options which seems promising.

The academics were top notch, and several of my peers are already successful in their careers; the degree as a label has traction in the job market.\n\nAs a Veteran who grew up in Minnesota, the weather was mild for me, but those from the South will find the winter challenging.\n\nI found myself very absorbed by my studies at that time, and so did most of the other students. That can make it extremely easy to meet people in an intellectual sense but somewhat difficult to meet in a social sense. My advice is if you want to date, you should learn how to meet people at NYU.\n\nFinancial aid is difficult to obtain, but I was a Veteran, and the government paid my tuition, so that was not my struggle.",

The university area is far away from the bustle of Time's Square, but close enough to walk/ take a train. The food... I could write essays about the food. It was a surreal experience for me.

Although it's supposed to be an executive program (for people with full-time jobs), registration for classes is available only a week before the semester starts, and the program/school has no regard for people that are unable to change their work schedules with a week's notice. The program itself does not offer a large variety of classes, and oftentimes students are left to take classes from other schools or program, and this means that they never have priority registration. Additionally, one of the required classes (Quantitative Techniques/Statistics) is only taught on Saturdays from 3-5PM followed by lab from 5-7PM, despite numerous complaints from everyone in the program. Waitlists for some classes are insane and new sections of the same class are not opened to meet demand.",

The curriculum is intense and you'll find yourself spending many nights studying. What you get out is extremely rewarding and you'll see the value of your education in your career. One thing I would change about Columbia is the curriculum. The intensity of each and every course along with the efforts on building a career or graduate school preparation is, in general, more than one can handle. I found myself learning little from some of my courses as I had to rush to complete my projects, tests, and other coursework. For an institution that holds learning as the highest priority, this has to change.",

Now that I am done with my first year, I realize this is the place I'm meant to be. While it wasn't an easy freshman year, it was a necessary one. I grew and will continue to do so.",

There are a lot of events always happening and the people attending are very diverse, but what can be improved is the diversity shown in academics and the Core. The Core is the required classes all students must take---most of them are very West-centered with Western thinking prioritized. However, with the diverse student body, the Core needs to become more diverse and reflect the diversity of the school. Right now, the academics prioritize Western, white men and that needs to be changed. The systematic racism also needs to be addressed better, as is a common issue with almost every school, especially the Ivies.",

But overall, Columbia lacks school spirit associated with school sports. I think such lack of school sports spirit is due to the fact that we have a very poorly performing football team and our cheerleaders and marching band are also mediocre. Plus, our football stadium is located in Bronx, not in Manhattan where the main campus is, so the physical distance also reduces student participation when football game occurs.",

However, I never planned to join a fraternity/become involved in the first place.  Some of the letter organizations live in brownstones all to themselves and of course throwing parties is a staple for most of them.  They also host campus events such as galas in coordination with other greek letter organizations or student led groups.  A fair amount of people don't participate in greek life at all (probably somewhere between 80-90%) since the metropolitan area doesn't really allow for the typical college frat/sorority atmosphere.  Most people go out into the city when they're partying, not many people want to be cramped in a brownstone on a saturday night, but there are those that do too.",

However, if we're looking at the numbers, Columbia accepts a very considerable amount of students from various backgrounds. For my entering first-year class (Class of 2016), 14% are African-American, 15% are Latino, and 29% are Asian/Asian-American. Also, there is a strong international presence with 19% of my class being students from other countries. You could say the undergraduate student body is a majority-minority; only 34% of students from my class are Caucasian (obtained from http://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/class_of_2016_profile.pdf). \r\n\r\nAs for economic background, the distribution of students from upper, middle, and lower classes is a little lopsided (there are more students from upper and middle classes). Nonetheless, half of the student body (in Columbia College and School for Engineering and Applied Sciences) are on financial aid. \r\n\r\nIn terms of political beliefs or sexual orientation, Columbians are known for their liberal side on any debate and there is a noticeable community of homosexuals who blend in and form a natural part of the Columbia community (I say that because I think it's important to know there isn't a stigma attached to that status and that it's perceived as a normal and accepted lifestyle in this community). Moreover, there is a nice mix of students interested in various majors and concentrations.",

Furthermore, as an elite school, the culture tends to be rather homogeneous, even among non-white, non-national students.  Politics vary, mostly siting in the moderate to liberal range.  Shout out to my leftists, and there are some ultra conservatives around too.  \r\n\r\nMultiple religions are represented on campus, but not all religions are treated with respect.  Judaism probably garners the most tolerance with its seemly both exotic and ubiquitous nature.  Christianity is next, though people will still snicker about the more extreme campus ministries (the ones with plans for infiltration and global domination) and you will be stopped on the street and told that Jesus loves you at least 10 times during your freshman year.  Hindu and Sikh students are present, but religiously very secluded, but do host events on holidays that are significant for these traditions.  Muslims, in true American fashion, have been the target of school and state sponsored monitoring during times when members of these communities, particularly students, were organizing politically.  \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of gays, though again most are white and fall into the moderate-liberal range.  There is a small bunch of radical POC (people of color) queers I roll with sometimes, but the campus climate toward reservation and prep preclude gayness from being broadcast on a day to day basis (which isn't a bad thing).  Again, the majority of the people at Columbia are straight and are either bro-ish (and thus have immature understanding of sex and sexuality, particularly about respect and consent) or prudish when it comes to sexuality.  Don't get me started on the whole Columbia/Barnard thing.  You will be devastated by the amount of concentrated immaturity and lack of consciousness in some of our \"future leaders.\"",

The scene here isn't like the colleges you see in movies; there's not really a push for going to games. That's not to say that we don't have amazing teams and games and fans though; the games are huge. I'm just saying that a lot of people choose to stay away from athletics. Also, I suppose it's worth mentioning that the football field is not on campus; it's a few miles uptown (but there's a free shuttle!) We also have an amazing fitness center though, very top-notch.",

Honestly, Columbia isn't known in the Ivy League or any league for that matter for being great at football, basketball, or any major sport. As a result, school spirit is lower than average when it comes to sports. However, little known, is that we have the #1 fencing team in the nation. And our swim team is pretty stellar.

There are a very large number of foreign transfer students here as well (my Russian roommate happens to be one). Many students coming from Asian countries, like China, find this to be one of the best schools to attend I hear.\r\n\r\nI think offering so many transfer students the opportunity to study here is good but it also makes the classes notoriously challenging to register for, even during the early registration window. Also, the campus feels kind of crowded at times...\r\n\r\nThere really aren't any issues with diversity here, regardless of the context one chooses to frame it in; whether economic, political, or sexual.

I came to Columbia not expecting to have anything to do with Greek life - in fact, I think many of the people in the system believed the same. Actually, Greek life is a little bigger than most people imagined. The percentages cited here are wrong, its a bit more like 10-15% now of the total (read CC, SEAS and Barnard) population (smaller for Columbia girls because Barnard girls take up a lot of the spots) due to the war on fun in other areas, such as crackdowns on dorms. \r\n\r\nIn fact, many (most? probably not) of the most outgoing people are Greek, which creates a nice little community that you always see when out. It's not only meatheads that are Greek here either - while yes, some of the athletes may have slipped by the admissions process somehow, most athletes are nice guys and there are three non-athlete associated fraternities. I'd say a large proportion of the attractive girls here are in sororities (maybe not most, but definitely heavily overrepresented). \r\n\r\nDownsides are that its a little shallow at times, and some non-Greek people snort at it but really this is not Animal House - it's still Columbia, and it allows some people to get more of a college experience while still enjoying everything Columbia has to offer. \r\n\r\nHousing consists entirely of smallish brownstones that are still large enough to have decent parties at times (mainly in basements etc) which sometimes sprawl several floors.

Most majors do not require an application, though a few require you to meet with an advisor before declaring.",

All of my professors have been middle and high school teachers for many years before going onto the college level. The majority of my professors have also written many textbooks, essays, and papers that pertain to my major and are the head of my field. Having had so much experience, most of my classes are based on hands-on learning. For example, we are required to develop our own lesson plans based on a single book provided by the professor or we experience the process of creating a character for a play by actively shadowing each other and observation. There are many opportunities to listen to guest speakers as well. The program is set up to have a guest speaker and a workshop every week of the semester. The topics have gone from using media for social justice in the classroom and the integration and application of LGBTQ literature in the classroom. There are also student-teaching opportunities all over the city. The program requires that each student works in both Middle and High school settings. The expectations and requirements of fulfilling the student-teaching assignments are very clear.A supplement class if required while student-teaching so that the student teachers may process and workshop what they have observed and learned in their classroom with other student teachers.",

The professors and teaching assistants are easily accessible through both email and in person. The curriculum is very specific to each major and there is a very clear outline of what is expected of each student. All requirements for graduation, certification, and class expectations are clearly spelled out. Although the workload is intensive, it is expected of such a rigorous and demanding school. The professors, assistants, and other staff are there to help the students every step of the way. What I like best about Teachers College is the fact that students are expected to collaborate, discuss, and explore the subjects as groups and then as individuals. We get as much in-field experience as possible and are provided with all the possible resources needed.

It's like every professor at the college has this undying need to make every subject 10 times harder than it should be and add tons of material that isn't in the textbook. They try to trick you on exams and add information to the exams that they did not teach in lecture. I honestly do not understand how anyone can maintain a 3.0.

Many students will note professors who are more concerned with research than teaching.  These professors do exist, and sadly are common, but the remedy is to drop theses classes and find better ones.  Ask around about which courses and professors are worth it.  Often, the answer may have nothing to do with professors, but with learning style.  If you like discussion, take seminars about topics you find interesting.  As a senior told me last year, you shouldn't have to take a class you don't like (except maybe Core Classes), so if you find yourself hating a class you're taking, it's your own fault.  Granted, there is less flexibility with the aforementioned Core, so you my have a teachers who is boring or who plays favorites and have no outlet to switch without messing up you're entire schedule.  But you should be able to find classes that are challenging and engaging, even entertaining if you try hard enough.",

Everyone is out for their own.",

All but one has been great, with quite a few being fantastic. The one was in Statistics, where every school is liable to have a few teachers who don't speak great English. The fantastic ones always give lively lectures, some are quirky, many  are well known nationally and internationally and there are a few who are lively, quirky AND renown. All in all, a great bunch.",

From burgers to Ethiopian, there is plenty of selection, and though not cheap, fairly high quality selection at that.

Between subways, buses, taxis, trains, ferries and even cable cars you can reach any corner of any of the five boroughs that make up the city easily, including the all the stadiums to any sporting event.

There are so many libraries on campus I'm not even sure of the number. All libraries provide a different atmosphere and are therefore filtered through by students frequently. Different atmospheres are typically preferred according to the subject being studied and the libraries provide excellent options. There is plenty of well maintained lawn space for students to lounge out on. It creates the illusion of not being in a big city while escaping the classrooms. Overall, student life is, in my opinion, above average. An excellent school that provides so much to their students.",

The program even continues the tradition of those who have served in the military, holding a Veteran population of over 400. General Studies students typically do very well at the school and professors enjoy the life experiences and insight brought into the classroom.

I don't think I've ever encountered a completely full computer lab.\r\n\r\nEach student is allotted a certain amount of pages for printing each month. I'm not quite sure what the limit is (I think it's 100 pages) since I'm only a first year; the amount of printing I've had to do has no where near approached the limit. For people who have to print out a lot of pages for papers or whatever, I hear there's a way to hack the printers for unlimited pages.\r\n\r\nThere's wifi all over campus, and the network's never been slow or down for me since the year started. However, my roommate mostly uses her iPad to access the internet, and it's lagged a bit for her a couple times.",

The main campus is located between Broadway and Amsterdam, so there are all kinds of stores within walking distance. The 116 Broadway subway stop is right in front the school gates, so transportations super convenient. Times Square is only a 20 min subway ride away. Museum Mile, on 5th avenue, is only a 30 min bus ride away. The school offers discount tickets to many of the shows, plays, and concerts currently showing, and your student ID lets you get into many museums and similar places for free.",

Classroom quality varies dramatically, but study space is readily available if one knows where to go (and where not to). True to New York form, negotiating and ensuring space availability will always present issues. Performing arts facilities could use an update; student music groups, for instance, are often forced to hold recitals in scattered lounges and lobbies around campus.",

The computers are usually in very good shape and software is always up-to-date. Printing is free for students, and the quota is fairly reasonable for undergrads based on the heavy coursework students have. Printing is easy, wherever there is a computer/computer lab/library, there will be a printer or two. If you are a Columbia student and you prefer to hang around with your laptop, that's not a reason to worry neither about printing as you can set up your personal device to print in the school's printers, this may vary a little for CU affiliates. Network is super reliable and decently fast, depend on campus location, usually libraries get the best reception. WIFI is free for everyone, even non-cu affiliates can access, just make sure to select the Columbia University network that does not have a lock next to!",

The School of Social Work is in a beautiful new building with all needed services for students. However, there is a lot of logistical protocol to organize any students groups or events that are not directly sponsored by the school. They do not let you put up fliers and charge a lot to provide students with meeting space. Another critique I have of the University as a whole is that there is not a lot of inter-school social interaction. Each school within the university has its own rules, buildings, and social events. One great thing that the school offers is a set tuition charge and then you can take unlimited classes per semester, at any of Columbia's schools.",

Instead, it's a lot like the city: you meet people and then go out to dinner or to smaller parties (in dorms, bars, frats, or downtown). Some people hate how broken up the community is, but a lot of people like it.",

On the main campus, most of the walkways are brick, so if the weather isn't good, leave the heels at home, but otherwise, it's fine.  The only real difficulty would be for anyone with a physical disability, because the wheelchair ramps and pathways aren't the best for navigation.

In terms of city life- what city can really claim to rival \"The Big Apple\"?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Broadway is amazing, but there's also Soho, Hell's Kitchen, Chinatown, and Lincoln Center. (Lincoln Center is awesome if you have an unexpected night free- show up an hour before the show and get a student rush ticket for $15!)\r\n\r\nPlus, with a Columbia ID you get free admission into almost every museum in NYC, and if you want to party- NYU is just a subway ride away.",

            "Review": "In my experience, Columbia gives out amazing financial aid. This is largely due to the school's policy to remove student loans from aid packages, making Columbia's aid markedly different from NYU (and many other larger institutions). My aid package was fair and lined up with my FAFSA EFC. The distinction between \"Work-Study\" and \"Casual Employment\" is a little fuzzy, and it is harder to get an on-campus job if you have the latter as part of your package.",

Resultantly, holds were placed on student accounts, disallowing students to register for classes.  The issue took over one year to resolve.  Moreover, students were forced to pay late registration fees o $150 because of Columbia's error.  Students at The School of General Studies DO NOT have the same access to financial aid as those of Columbia College, even though their need is greater.  It's time to merge the two schools two stop this systemic financial discrimination directed a segment of the student population.  Shameful indeed.",

Honestly, while I've rarely had a really good meal, I've had very few meals that tasted bad- mostly ranges from bland but edible to pretty good. Ferris pasta station is always an option. The main downside to campus food is that the meal plan is quite overpriced, especially in comparison to the multitude great, practical dining options in Morningside Heights. Still, having eaten meals at other colleges and hosted friends from other colleges, I can say that Columbia's dining options are much better than the vast majority of college campus food, including most other pricy private universities.",

Only a couple blocks down from the campus are a couple of Starbucks, for the caffeine boost, and a Chipotle. There are also a couple other restaurants nearby. However, if you're looking for good eats, going a little more downtown is the best. One of my favorite places is called Cafe 28. It is down along 28th street and Broadway, a little ways down from where the campus is, but there is a large variety of dishes with the addition of a cafe. The food there is reasonably priced and prepared daily.",

The slices are (literally) bigger than my head!\r\n\r\nNot to forget, we also have the requisite Starbuck's on every corner, although Oren's Daily Roast serves a much better coffee if you don't mind a few extra minutes of walking. \r\n\r\nOh, and the Hungarian Pastry Shop on Amsterdam has free WiFi and AMAZING pastry!

            "Review": "Columbia undergraduate housing is done in an lottery system in which each student is given a lottery number that determines when they can apply for their desired housing. The lottery system gives priority to seniors. Thus seniors get to choose their housing first, then juniors, and so on. The lottery system can be confusing, but Columbia Housing does a good job of clarifying it's process via email updates, website, flyers, and information sessions. All dorms have heaters while only some dorms have AC units in each room. It's best to live in corridor-style dorms with individual AC+heating unites in each room (such as Furnald, Broadway, John Jay, etc.) and these corridor-styles are more affordable than other dorms. Hartley is one of the worst dorms: (1) it's one of the oldest dorms so the carpet is old and dirty (bad for people with carpet, dust mite allergies); (2) no AC; (3) heater does not work in many rooms; (4) cockroach and mice infestation in lower floors if students share kitchen with untidy suite mates. \r\n\r\nColumbia resident halls have great security that ensure only valid undergraduate CU student ID holders can enter building unless guests are signed-in appropriately.",

It is conveniently close to all classroom buildings (for the most part) and is mostly clean. Freshman housing is nice and ideally located next to the main library and on top of the three dining halls. Sophomore year is a crap shoot, but it gets better, and getting singles all four years is not impossible. The housing lottery (after freshman year) is confusing, but any upperclassman can explain it, and people get a weird thrill out of calculating their probability of getting different rooms, so it ends up being a bonding experience. On the other hand, if you get stuck in a bad dorm, it really sucks. McBain and Nussbaum both have pest problems, and a lot of the dorms lack a/c, which sucks in September. But even then, you join a tradition of Columbia students who have dealt with the same problems for decades. As for a social scene in the dorms, it varies greatly depending on who you live with. I lived in the \"anti-social\" freshman dorm, Furnald, and had a great social life. So it is what you make of it.",

The lottery system can be a pain, but the LLC or other suite options are the best for upperclassmen. The social atmosphere of the school is amazing thanks to this on-campus housing rule: we're guaranteed all four years of housing here.

Unless you're willing to make the trek from Washington Heights, the cheapest apartment you'll find is over $1500 a month, including sublets in Harlem.  This isn't really Columbia's fault, just the fact that New York real estate is exorbitantly priced.  The Upper West Side isn't even an option for most college students, and Harlem is quickly undergoing gentrification, making affordable housing a problem.  However, since housing is guaranteed all 4 years, it's not really that bad for most students.  On the subject of parking - what a joke.  Nobody in college in New York City has a car.",

The dorms themselves vary from amazing studio apartments overlooking the Hudson to cramped, tiny doubles. Private bathrooms are rare and most of the best housing options go to upperclassmen (though there are many great freshman options and Columbia gives you the rare opportunity to live in a single as a freshman). Most dorms are within a reasonable distance from campus (15 minute walk max) and many display the historic architecture of Columbia and the city. The housing lottery is a bit complex and very stressful if you don't get a stellar number. Kitchen facilities are mediocre in most dorms. Best option: Watt studio singles. Worst option: McBain Double (mostly sophomore dorm).",
