Housing was perfectly accommodating and the process when completed timely is simple and effective. College specific advisors were, again, instrumental to my success in completing the appropriate university requirements for graduation, completing the proper prerequisites for my undergraduate program, and in my future application to graduate school. The opportunities for participation in social activities, sports/recreation, professional development, clubs, organizations, and so on are ENDLESS. There is something for everybody. The university promotes DEI. Most, if not all, professors are accommodating, patient, resourceful, and demonstrate genuine interest/ passion in course subject and helping students succeed. UF would be my choice every time.",

Though I have only experienced a few months with the university, it has been a truly life-changing experience to say the least. I have been able to experience fun opportunities and apply for mentorship programs as well as talk to amazing groups and clubs that are so passionate about what they achieve. I am a UF online student, but I still get to experience the same opportunities as my peers who may be on campus. UF is inclusive, and all around an amazing campus and university bursting at the seams with opportunity. I am so humbled and overjoyed that I get to know the joys of being a UF Online student, and I can’t wait for all I have yet to experience. Go Gators!",

For those who like to study there are special dorms that tend to be more quiet and there are cafes off campus to study at. However they also have sority row which will allow for the more extroverted people to go out and party, they have dorms that tend to be louder and hnagout more.

The academics are extremely rigorous but usually feel like they are contributing to your abilities in a positive manner. The biggest issue I had at the University of Florida was with the advising, or lack thereof. Advisors are extremely difficult to get in contact with and your emails and questions can oftentimes get passed from person to person without being answered. However, there are lots of students and staff who do want to help you and who are willing to sort of fill this role. If you are able to make connections with a few professors in your first year or so you will be ok even if your advisors and administration are less than helpful.",

I got into my top 2 choices: Duke (go Blue Devils) and Notre Dame (go Irish), but cost-wise, both options were simply unrealistic. So, I didn't come into freshman year with the rose-tinted glasses that most freshman do at a legacy school like mine. I was quick to point out anything that I didn't like because I guess, in my mind, it reinforced my elevation of the other schools I go into. But to be frank, there wasn't much to point out. The culture surrounding Duke and Notre Dame were the main draws for me. Yes, I wanted to attend an academically rigorous school, but I also wanted to, you know, have fun! I didn't realize until I got up here but UF offers, in my opinion, the best of both worlds. I'm a part of the honors program, so I have to option to \"up the ante\" so to speak on the academic side of things, but since UF is an SEC school with deep traditions, there's also a lot...else to enjoy!",

Although some of the science department professors could use revision in their teaching methodology. Personally, I am not able to thoroughly learn (and I know many others I have spoken to share the same feelings) through the new teaching method of \"flipped learning\" where the students watch pre-recorded lectures that have been recycled since 2018 on their own time and the in-person lectures are not spent being taught.",

FSU and UCF has this too, of course, but not quite the global reach that UF seems to have.\n\nUF is also the town’s whole identity.

            "Review": "UF is a great place to go if you have no other option. It's a politically charged climate, with leadership chasing arbitrary metrics to make UF \"Top 10,\" without a tangible vision otherwise. Apparently some board member's daughter wanted to go to UMich instead of UF and their bitterness is now University policy. Of course, there's also the drama behind appointing a republican senator with no experience to run the place for a year and a half. Big surprise that ended with a vague scandal. Lets not forget the faculty at UF signed a professor application for an anti-vaxxer who is now the FL surgeon general. What a bastion for academic rigor. It's a campus that has sold its academic soul to conservative donors and State government grants, like a vestigial appendage, or perhaps tumor. We spend lots of (tuition) money recruiting academics from top-tier institution, who usually leave within a couple years after they see dumpster fire. That being said, it's probably the best school in Florida.",

Faculty's veto of said President was forgone by Board of Trustees who are in majority profiteers of large development businesses. Office politics that also exist here reflect this environment as its seeps into each departments funding and future plans. Growth of off campus housing has exploded and deteriorated the unique community that use to surround the neighborhoods of campus. As an Alum with many friend and family members who have also attended UF, its good to see present students and faculty fighting for their voices against the conservative government that is trying to dismantle preeminent academics. While your education will depend upon personal commitment and those around you, understand the even those whose will want to stay out of politics will be confronted by it on multiple fronts I certainly was.",

The courses are more rigorous here compared to other colleges but as long as you pay attentions to lectures, take notes, and give yourself ample time to study you will be fine, it's manageable as long as you take the right steps. Once you fall behind it's hard to catch up. I stayed on campus my first year. I stayed in Thomas Hall during my freshman summer semester, do not recommend it, the rooms themselves were nice and bigger than expected but it is a communal bathroom and our bathroom flooded at one point and was unusable for several weeks, we had to go to other dorms to access their bathrooms. During Fall and Spring I was in Hume Hall, I enjoyed it way better and I never had any problems, though if you have a car parking can be difficult as the parking spots fill up fast. Overall, I've really liked UF and while Gainesville is small there is more to do here than I thought.",

However, the facilities provided by the university were extremely helpful, as they had multiple bus routes to go around town, they had food provisions on campus for those even without meal plans for a low rate, and had lots of resources if help was needed. This made it really easy to adjust and made making friends and meeting new peers easier as I had lesser things to worry about. Something that I would have liked to change however is the fact that during weekends it was extremely hard to go around town without a car as the bus routes barely run and it makes it quite difficult to get anywhere when in need of something. Overall though, coming to UF has been a great experience and I love it here.",

The University has so many options, resources and contacts for students to create a path for success. There are in class and online options but both options offer a wonderful student life involvement.  Instructors and curriculum is progressive and offers multiple options.  Greek Life is amazing and happy with so many options available.  Dorm life is almost a Rite of Passage and it has been an amazing journey!  Go Gators!",

There are so many ways to get involved, not just through greek life. Your experience at UF is what you make of it, and I feel that it is truly a place where you get just as much out of it as you put into it. Adjusting to such independent living has been difficult, but there are so many resources here, and no one  has ever made me feel bad for being new or needing guidance. If there was one thing I would like to see changed are the limited amount of parking available on campus. The lack of space for the cars that are here make for frustrated drivers and in turn, unsafe driving habits. As a student who mostly walks everywhere, I would like to see more of a focus on traffic safety.",

Although my freshman year was cut short due to COVID-19, in that short year alone I knew that Gainesville was a new home for me.\nToday I look back and realize the five short years I spent with the University, the surrounding city, and the people that make Florida the school I fell in love with. As a former student athlete competing in cross country and track and field, I was fortunate to experience both normal college life, and the rather tough but rewarding life of a Division I athlete. Despite all my ups and downs, and the long days trying to balance my athletic and personal life while keeping up in school, I would not trade my experience for the world. I have come to learn how strong ‘Gator Nation’ is and how much pride people have for my school, something I can happily say I have too.",

            "Review": "The University of Florida is a great school for online students. I am a student in the Fire and Emergency services program and have enjoyed my time here. Although I am an out of state student, the tuition rates for this school are more affordable than an in-state institution where I live in Tennessee. Also, the academics are sufficiently challenging. The professors that I've had have all been very helpful, welcoming calls or emails. There are a few programs noted for their fire science across the nation, such as Oklahoma State University but they are so much more costly. Another great aspect of being an online student at University of Florida is being treated like an on-campus student. You have access to all campus facilities, can purchase Florida Gators football student season tickets, etc. While many \"colleges\" that cater to fire and emergency services are basically degree mills and lack the reputation that the University of Florida offers. UF has instant name recognition.",

The availability of social resources and career growth/development opportunities is also something I've come to appreciate during my time here.

I have had difficulties selecting courses that are essential to my degree because of the lack of availability, even in online spaces.",

There are little to no events where you can meet people, or at least nothing is very advertised, so not many people know about the events that are going on. The few events that have been hosted, though, were interesting and had some fun and exciting aspects to them, for example, there was one night where they had freshwater oysters that you could choose from and have the pearl taken out and put into a necklace to take home. The dining hall food is not great, it slowly decreases in quality throughout the semester and the menus they put online are inaccurate at times, but the other retail places on campus are not too bad. The one thing I love about campus is how beautiful it is and how many study spots, benches, and community areas there are. Overall it's a good university thus far and enjoy the community!",

The atmosphere of being around fellow students while cheering for the Florida Gators in football, baseball, softball, or basketball. I also frequently go to the library to study on campus. Since I live off-campus and only take online classes (for the time being), being able to participate and feel like a normal college student is a feeling that has been so unbelievably important to me over the past few semesters.\nThere are a handful of things that I do want to see changed, however.

UF benefits from a mix of urban and natural environments, the city is a friendly, college-town vibe and plenty of outdoor activities, cultural events, and a warm climate. However, there are areas for improvement. Some introductory courses can be quite large, making it challenging for students to get individual attention.

I do certainly agree that the springs were beautiful and is filled with nature. However, as a person who likes indoors and cooler temperatures, the nature aspect is not enough to overlook the inconsistent weather, the lack of entertainment buildings/areas, the poor quality restaurants, and the lack of transportation. Although, I would mention, growing up in Japan, my expectation of a functional city is much different than that of an American person.

Each student understands the work you have previously put in and respect your journey, which leads to becoming close as the road ahead will be harsh and will be filled with rewards. The dorm space is an interesting first year interaction that can be recommend to all as being away from home can be harsh if to be left alone, so having someone or a group around you grants peace of mind with your environment. Although the showers can be seen as an issue, the work load and path ahead points you to disregard those minor bumps to a future for you to expand upon and any resources needed are given to you.",

I was able to find many friends through these pathways, however I feel like there is definitely a fall off after the first year.

I love how involved students are because it is a constant inspiration to get involved and make a difference on campus.

However, one is to assume that a very selective university with many competitive applicants would have a very smart student body; nope a lot of the campus make themselves look like they don't even go there do to their attitudes not aligning itself with the extremely difficult entry. Ultimately, UF should increase their rate of acceptance while also not running off a lottery system, rather they should remark for merit (athletics isn't merit).",

The curriculum is challenging, considering UF is a top 30 school nationwide. However, it is doable if you put in the time and work. I have made many friends at UF, including two close friends. UF is a great place to know who you are and become a better you while exploring new things that you might not have liked before.",

Because of this, there is always improvement occurring around campus. There is currently a new dining hall being constructed, and renovations being done on many existing buildings. The classes are a bit difficult to get into as a freshman, but as you progress, you will have higher chances of getting your top-choice times, etc. There is almost always a game going on, and they are a lot of fun to attend. The academics aren't terribly difficult, but some struggle more than others. It's a very well-rounded school that has something for just about everyone; you just need to be able to find it.",

It's been my dream school since I moved to Florida in fourth grade, and so far it has met all of my expectations. The classes are challenging and although some of my classes are of varied sizes, I do feel like my professors care about my well-being and success in my college experience. My biggest challenge comes from learning how to adequately study for each of my classes, especially since every teaching style and exam structure is so different. Without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite part of being a student here is the culture. The people, the atmosphere, and the resources available to me have made my college experience an extremely positive one so far, and I am excited to continue to discover the ways I can grow here.",

The fraternities and sororities do a ton of fun activities together, but they don't really interact with any non-Greek life students. There's no tension or anything, they just kind of stay in their own bubble.",

The University of Florida does have very good Football and Basketball programs, but what makes UF one of the best overall athletic programs in the country is the fact that we are very dominant in the sports that do not receive as much attention. We are consistently dominant in sports like softball, gymnastics, track and field, swimming and diving, and many more. This dominance in athletics translates to a strong school spirit amongst the many UF students who take pride in being Gators.",

Tailgating before the games and then walking into the swamp is one of the greatest things to ever do on campus, if not the greatest. The football players are basically Gods on campus though. The basketball games are always fun too! The O'Connel center is now being redone but I'm sure it will still be as packed as it was last year. What makes the basketball games great too is that they're free!!! Every sporting event other than football is free to students. Sports is definitely a major part of the University of Florida and there's reason behind it.",

As a girl it is easy to still have a social life without being in a sorority because you can still attend frat parties. As a boy not in a fraternity, having a social life is a lot more difficult. You cab't attend frat parties or events so you'll have to stick to the bar scene which can be pretty pricey after a while and a little boring if you are under drinking age. I definitely recommend going Greek for both boys and girls because it gives you a much larger social life and it's so much easier to hear about things going on.",

Some Greek students are great and others aren't. Usually people don't judge just because someone is in a Greek.

The Greek life brings more students together and helps make us one big community. Many students either want to be part of the greeks for the connections and friends but if they don't, they are not treated any differently by their choice. Many of the Greek organizations have housing on campus that is offered to their members if they would like to be more involved.",

There are a lot of \"prestige\" organization that you can't join without these Greek connections. Student Government is known to revolve around the Greek community and it's involvement. You almost can't be involved in SG without having letters. Greeks are known to be cliquey and the secrets they have with pledging are known to get between friendship, including very close ones. It's almost like you're Greek or you're not. It's not easy to see any overlap.",

Filling out an application, having my parents fill out their section, and providing proof of Florida Residency, due to the fact, that they placed me in as an out-of-state student, which I have lived in the same area of Florida, my entire life.  Small error to fix, even though somewhat inconvenient, since I just started my 4th year at UF, no big deal, except when I saw what an out-of-state student would have had to pay if in my same position.  Wow!  Due to the graduate school being separate from the bachelor's program, everything had to be done over again, and that error happened to 2 other friends of mine, so we had to do quite a bit of hustling to get it all in by September 5th, but all is fine now.",

The facilities like the chemistry lab building for freshman is terrible in my opinion because its just disgusting. The advisors love to push internships and job opportunities on freshman and stress them out but i think they are wrong to do that. Most major companies will not give you an internship until your junior year when you have some experience in your field. Also, if you focus on research and internships and let your grades fall below a 3.0 average then you are absolutely in bad shape. HR looks at your GPA first thing before you get an interview. If it is below a 3.0 you can hardly get a job anywhere unless you work contract jobs, which do not pay as well and the work conditions will be sub par.",

I have a GED and AA, so it was a bit stressful trying to figure out how to fill out the application. It also took a while for my permanent residency to be validated, so for a while I was accepted as an international student.\r\n\r\nAs a transfer student, the most important criteria for admission were an AA degree, a good GPA, and having all the right classes taken for biology (like Chemistry 1 and 2). The essays were short (in fact it was hard to fit all I wanted to say in them!), and probably pretty different from the freshman application process.\r\n\r\nTip: leave enough time to go through the application form. It wasn't nearly as straightforward or user-friendly as I expected from such a large institution.",

The tests and homework's are made harder than they should be to 'weed-out' students, since these course have a large volume of students. In such courses professors will see you as a number unless you make the time and effort for them to know you, and grade policies are very strict. The workload is sometimes overwhelming, but manageable. There are some courses and majors at the University not offered, but there are alternatives to this. The preprofessional  courses get tougher and more time-consuming.",

Cultural organizations are always hosting events, the city of Gainesville puts on a lot of activities, the Phillips Center consistently has performances, and the Harn Museum of Art is a gorgeous place to meander around. The university has endless activities for students to participate in, especially in the recreation centers. The city of Gainesville has a lot to offer anyone and everyone! Gainesville itself may seem a little \"in the middle of nowhere\", but it has everything you need and want, and is a great place to spend your undergrad years.",

However, some buses take longer to arrive, which makes it a problem when students are late to class or a meeting and rely on the bus as their only for of transportation. Also, the buses stop running fairly early on Saturdays which poses a big problem for students, since Saturday is the designated day to run errands and accomplish tasks that are otherwise hard to do during the week. Snap, the other form of transportation, is also very good. It provides a safe form of transpiration during late nights. However, sometimes it may take almost an hour to pick up students and the drivers can decide whether you are within distance of picking up. If not they can easily cancel your ride, and you may need to resubmit another form, wasting valuable time.",

Since college students are a diverse group the types of activities you can find in Gainesville are diverse too. Anything from poetry slams to rock concerts. restaurants are also open late and cater to different crowds. People are friendly and respect all students because UF is a distinguished school. The only thing I would say we are lacking in is shopping. Food wise we are fine, plenty of grocery stores for all tastes and wallet sizes but there is only one mall and it's relatively small. It does have all the stores you would need though. Unfortunately if you need a speciality store like Apple, you have to travel far",

The more that your are involved, the more people you will meet and therefore you will have more connections and discover even more opportunities! Academic advisors can help you choose your classes for your major and they can also give you information to help you get involved if you do not know where to start. There are numerous clubs and organizations that tailor to your interests and different types of organization fairs that range from helping you find part-time work, volunteer opportunities and even internships. Personally being a minority at this school could make you feel like you will not fit in however, there are many different cultural groups that you can join as well whether if it's related to your major or simply something that you enjoy doing! When I first started I struggled with my confidence and kept to myself. However, I soon learned how to get out of my comfort zone and become open mined to tremendous experiences. The opportunities here will help you learn that college is more then just studying and parties but it is a growing experience that you can take with you even after graduation.",

You will not receive any aid if you do not do this and the faster you get it done, the faster they can come up with a package for you. Most of my aid came from loans from the school, as well as Bright Futures. I did receive a merit based grant at one point, but it was soon lost when my brother stopped attending college elsewhere. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be many scholarships available through the university. However, other options exist. One option that I swear by is Federal Work Study. You can request this on your FASFA, and then if you get it you will be allotted a certain amount of money that you can earn through a work study job. UF has many such jobs open to students, both on and off campus. Most are minimum wage jobs, but if you search around enough you can find higher paying jobs. I, myself, ended up with a cushy job tutoring children for above minimum wage and I loved every second of it! I think the best part about these jobs is that they are close by and are willing to work with students with a busy curriculum.",

I temporarily lost a scholarship as a result of some extenuating circumstances, but was refunded the scholarship on the condition that I receive therapy. When I was undergoing the process of appealing that scholarship, my financial aid adviser gave horrible customer service, and at one point had given me false information on due dates adding more stress to myself and the adults involved in my case. It seemed like a miracle that I was able to get all the paperwork on time, because I was heavily dependent on that adviser. Once we managed to get all the paperwork in, a different adviser helped me easily and quickly. I relied on her instead for all my needs. Her kindness and depth of knowledge lifted a lot of weight off our shoulders and I'm happy to say that I can continue to afford attending this university with her help.",

One such place is called Relish. It's a burger joint with the quality and price of a Five Guys, but with so many more options! The best part about them is that they are open really late, til about 2am most nights! Another great restaurant Gainesville has is called Peach Valley cafe. It's a breakfast and lunch restaurant, but my favorite part about it is the breakfast! The food is great, the service is better, and the cost is reasonable! It's a very popular restaurant; I don't think I've ever gone there without having to wait at least 5 minutes for a table, but it is so worth it! Overall, I'd say Gainesville has a huge selection of dining options, and everyone eventually finds a place that they swear by, and that they can't find anywhere else!",

I think the best part about the campus food is how accessible it is. There are restaurants and convenience stores everywhere so you never have to go too far away from classes for a meal or a snack. I would definitely not recommend eating on campus everyday just because it can get a little pricey, but if you forgot your lunch and can spare the cash the University of Florida has some awesome options for food.",

            "Review": "I'd say it ultimately is worth getting the meal plan for at least one's first semester, just to see how it plays out with the student. Some will find it very convenient (which it is; it's generally just a walk away from your dorm), while others will find it to be paying for poor quality food. The dining hall food isn't always the best, but it is pretty consistent with its breakfast options (eggs, potatoes, sausage), and there's always a salad bar and a sandwich station that you can't go wrong with. The vegan and grill stations usually have pretty good food. I don't eat much around campus, like at the Reitz Union food court, though the Croutons place can make you a great salad. If you don't get the meal plan, flex bucks are certainly worth it, as they can pay for certain items at the food court not necessarily on the meal plan, as well as other amenities, like any item at the P.O.D. markets. Gainesville does has some good, legitimate restaurants off campus (The Top, Burrito Brothers) that are definitely worth checking out.",

I don't eat out too much but we do have a lot of Hispanic, Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisine here. I definitely have favorite restaurants (Mi Appa, 4 Rivers Smokehouse, Southern Charm Kitchen, Bagels and Noodles), but I try not to spend too much money on going out because university is so costly. I don't think the price of food here in Gainesville is anymore expensive than my hometown as long as the establishment isn't located on campus.",

            "Review": "I don't really rely on on-campus dining options so I don't frequent many of the places UF has to offer. Every now and then I will buy chick-fil-a, go to subway, or get a sub from Little Hall Express. I try to avoid buying food from campus because I find that the better value is easily any place else. The options are slightly more expensive than usual and refills aren't free. As ridiculous as the latter sounds it is a complaint I never cease to think, or hear from other students. I believe that a lot of universities are driven by monetary gain now more than ever, and the dining options are easily an example of that. If I purchased something on campus it would be something that was already pretty cheap, or I'd have to be desperately hungry (to the point of being physically unable to perform) and unable to walk to an off-campus location. As dramatic as that also sounds, as a college student every little purchase adds up, and I just don't have the money to afford to go out to eat. So not eating for the duration that I am on campus is something I find myself doing often. This is not unique to me, plenty of my working class- lower class peers practice similar habits. Spending more than 30 dollars a month on food is just not an option for us, if we want to be able to keep up with the other major expenses that going to university has (outside of the tuition) such as paying for books, for access to do homework, access to supplemental mandatory class materials, for tutors to teach the materials in certain classes that students generally struggle to learn from the professors themselves (studyedge, tutoring zone), parking decals etc.",

I can use my meal plan at the two dining halls on campus, Subway, Crouton's, Home Zone, Camellia Court Cafe, Moe's Southwest Grille, Chomp It, Pollo Tropical, Papa John's and Burger King.

Of course, every person varies on their opinions of living on campus, but I have lived on campus going on three academic years now and have no complaints. However, I would strongly recommend either not doing random roommate request unless you are not very particular or have a roommate in mind already for the year.",

I think I feel this way just because I am definitely not a fan of public bathrooms. That's the biggest thing about the dorms that I do not feel to fondly of. Other than that, sharing a room and being close to people is super cool. It kind of forces you to make friends unless you really really don't want to. The next biggest thing that I don't like about dorms are the prices. Off campus housing is definitely what I am doing from now on. The housing costs more than the tuition!!!",

But, it was an experience and I would recommend incoming freshman to share this same experience. There are now new dorm building such as infinity hall, it looks beautiful and new on the outside. The froward area is probably the most popular, it is in the center of campus and close to everything. I would recommend living here if possible for a freshman.",

Aside from the social aspect, Broward wasn't the most comfortable place to live. I had to share a tiny room with two other girls and on top of that share a bathroom with several other girls at the end of the hall. I was constantly getting sick due to living in such close quarters with so many people. Looking back, I spent a lot of my time at Windsor Hall because one of my friends lived there. Windsor was in the perfect location for me because its right by sorority row which is where I eat all of my meals. If I could go back I would probably live in Windsor as opposed to Broward.",

I overall felt safe because campus is always busy no matter what time it is. The dorms are old, but I think living on campus made it easier to make friends, get better sleep (since I could walk to class), and regularly attend events and meetings since I didn't have to take the bus there. My RA was also awesome with getting to know us, having free food and get togethers and talking to us one-on-one. I even went to her after a bad break-up. My RA was probably one of the few RAs that did this because most students just said that their RA didn't even talk to them.",

However, the housing options to make students happy are extensive. There are single rooms, double rooms, triple rooms, apartment style, suite style, and luxury dorm options. The best dorms are Beaty Towers, Cypress Hall, and Jennings Hall. The worst dorms are some of the older buildings, but for the most part everything is pretty decent. Dorms are EXTREMELY well placed in terms of proximity to classes and to the more popular parts of town. The housing process is easy to understand and almost everyone gets their housing preferences.",

Along with the adjustment to living on your own, the conveniency of living with a fifteen minute walk from all of your classes provides the comfort of running back to your dorm in between classes, and getting some fresh air walking to class.

You get your own room in an apartment with three other roommates and two bathrooms. There is also a kitchen and a living room area. \r\n\r\nBeaty is a 14 foot tall apartment style building. Fire alarms = going down 11 flights of stairs. They're pretty cozy though and close to Chick-Fil-A. \r\n\r\nKeys and Springs are similar to Lakeside but a bit larger, except usually reserved for upper class men. \r\n\r\nMurphree area halls are older and closer to the nightlife but old and some without air conditioning. \r\n\r\nCypress and Infinity are new dorms.

You don't have to worry about monthly utility payments/rent while in school because it was all paid for to begin with therefore alleviating the financial stress during semesters. You are completely surrounded by classsmates of varying backgrounds and cultures allowing you to open your eyes to your school's level of diversity as well as make friends with those in the same boat as you. The cost is a bit higher to live in a confined, cramped space.",

However, as we are somewhat of a party school, if you live in a dorm with community bathrooms, be prepared to deal with the after effects of others' partying. Fair warning, custodians don't come in during the weekend and most of your peers won't want to clean up after themselves. Other than that, the rooms are adequate for what you need during school. The AC units in my experience were always working well.",

The dorms especially on the east side of campus, such as Broward, Rawlings, Mallory, Beaty Towers, and others are very convenient to get to classes. The dorms towards the center of campus such as Murphree as well as Graham are close to the stadium and gym facilities. The dorms in general are moderately clean and the room sizes in most dorms are decent. The RAs usually do nice things for the residents like baking cookies or having fun meetings.",

You're close to just about everything you'd need, and if you feel walking or biking to your destination is too much there is always a bus stop nearby.

However, convenience and quality do come with a price so it really depends on how much you are willing to spend on proximity and quality! Usually: good quality and close proximity $$$, Good quality and relatively close proximity $$, not so good quality but close proximity $. There is also very good quality but not very good proximity: $$. Although be careful when looking at prices because some places are unfurnished and/ or don't include utilities in their monthly cost. There are also places that are joint lease only (usually places more for town residents than college students) so don't be fooled by the prices and be careful on where you sign!",

I know the dorms seem convenient and nice, but you can't beat the off-campus housing. There are an incredible number of options, and most are actually cheaper and way bigger than anything you can find on-campus. Also, it is super easy to find an apartment that is right for you. Many websites exist that can help you filter through results and find the best match. Or, if you'd rather talk to a human you can walk right in to any leasing office and can copies of floor plans and prices right then and there. The staff are always really nice and can set up tours for you very quickly. I have lived off-campus for 3 years now and can tell you that I will never go back to a dorm!",

My dorm was fairly small, and cost as much as an apartment in which I wouldn't have had to share my bedroom (which I definitely did while staying on campus). However, the amenities were great. I had access to a kitchen and bathroom in which someone else cleaned. The common room had a balcony and a flat screen TV in which we could hang out or study. There was also an affordable laundry facility on site. In addition, I had access to an art studio and art gallery (the dorm was populated by many art students) though I personally did not use them. At other dorms on campus there were other amenities that I also had access to. This included access to several swimming pools, two gyms, a couple of billiards tables, meditation rooms, and many other great amenities that were included in the cost of my dorm. Overall, I had a positive experience living on campus and would recommend it to any freshman or sophomore looking to make some close friends and live 5 minutes away from class!",

            "Review": "In my freshman year of college, I have already lived in two dorms, one in the summer, another in the fall and spring. My first dorm experience, Springs, was a rather good one, with the rooms being quite spacious. It's not a very social hall, which, for the time being, was nice, as I was able to bond with my suitemates, and study for exams peacefully. It's not very close to the main part of campus, though the bus system is very efficient and can take you across campus in no time. Plus, the isolationism is nice in the summer when there aren't many students attending. My current dorm, Reid Hall, is more traditional in its style, with smaller (mainly) double rooms across each floor, which, along with the lounge area at the end of the hall, contributes to making it a social dorm, which, in the fall and spring, is almost crucial; I've become friends with almost everyone on my floor. Reid is part of the Yulee complex building, which includes the dorms, Yulee, Mallory, and Reid. With social events at the beginning of each semester and onward, there being a whole complex with multiple dorms opens windows for people to meet others. And, it is in close proximity to much of the campus.",

I am a little out from my classes but the bus service is excellent and it has never been an issue getting to my classes. The cost of where I am residing is a little more expensive than if I was in a dorm right in the middle of the campus. I am close to a gym and it is a quiet area that I live in. The post office is across the street and there is a nice lake that I can walk to that is a nice place to relax and study. The only thing is that places for me to eat that are on my meal card are right on campus and once I get back to my dorm I do not go back to campus to eat. I make alot of my own meals and a grocery store is not far from my apartment. All in all I do like it the I live on the edge of the campus.",

            "Review": "Living off campus is a much wiser choice than living on campus. It's cheaper to have an apartment with a room and bathroom to yourself off-campus than it is to share one room with two other girls in a dorm that has no a/c unit, with bathrooms that have no locks or even stalls to protect individuals in the showers (and I lived in the cheapest dorm). Apartments closest to campus are generally for the more wealthy demographic and are generally not an option for anyone else. The best choices are apartments and houses. I didn't even realize help could be found through the school, it's possible there isn't help at all. I don't see why the school would take it upon themselves to locate off-campus housing for students unless it was overflow housing at Oakbrook Walk. Living off campus is always the wiser option. Parking varies from place to place, some apartments require decals or have allotted visitor parking. Some houses are located in neighborhoods that require permits in order to simply park on the street. Having a car off-campus is pretty pointless anyways since parking options at UF are the worst and most unaccommodating I've probably ever seen. If you have a scooter you're better off, but the weather conditions in Gainesville don't allow for it to be a pleasurable experience on most days.",

            "Review": "I'm currently a junior and have lived in five different residence halls since I was a freshman, specifically Murphree, Jennings, Riker, Lakeside, and Broward. All of these halls are IMMENSELY different and the one you'll like the most really depends on what you're looking for \r\n\r\nMurphree is popular because of it's proximity to classes and how it looks, but I hated it for its old facilities and because the common area is separate from any of the halls in the area, doing laundry is a pain because of the long walk from your room to the commons, which seems even longer when you're carrying several weeks' worth of laundry! If you're on a meal plan, the only nearby food is Moe's.\r\n\r\nJennings is more recently renovated and has nicer facilities and lots of space in it's common area and basement. However, there were a lot of rowdy girls on my floor who would make a ton of noise in the hallway at 2 a.m. on a weekday night and would slam doors and puke in the hall while I'm trying to sleep. Also, while I might have just gotten really unlucky, people on my floor were absolutely DISGUSTING with leaving the bathroom a complete mess.\r\n\r\nRiker is not renovated and the Tolbert Area is not the closest to campus, but it's definitely not as far as other areas (plus numerous buses run by it) and you're right behind Gator Corner if you're on a meal plan. I also had a single, so that made it all worth it.\r\n\r\nLakeside's distance is terrible, as is its $3,000+ price per semester and it has the same laundry room issues as Murphree. But it's not bad if you can look past those things. You get you're own room (albeit a tiny one), a bathroom you only have to share with one other person, and your own kitchen.\r\n\r\nBroward has been my favorite by far. It's the most recently renovated hall, is the closest to campus, has tons of places to study and hang out, and there's a Chick-Fil-A right next door! I also lucked out with a huge single that is a few square feet away from being the size of a double.",
