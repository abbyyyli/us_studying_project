The care of the police department leaves a lot to be desired as arbitrarily hand out tickets and are incompetent. Overall however college is a bit of a scam and I would recommend finding something else to do. Hell maybe join a church and get an education that way. It's not a good environment to learn given the cost.",

My experience at Rice University has been overwhelmingly positive, characterized by its exceptional academic environment and unique residential college system. The small class sizes foster close relationships with professors, who are accessible and dedicated to student success. Hands-on, project-based learning opportunities, such as those available in the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen, have enriched my education. Additionally, the residential college system creates a tight-knit community that enhances social connections and provides leadership opportunities, making it easy to form lasting friendships.",

            "Review": "Rice University is a great school for all-rounders—people who have more than one passion in life and want to explore all these passions together. They emphasize this even in the more intensive majors. They also focus on creating a socially healthy atmosphere for students by allowing student leaders to have a say in campus policies, as well as providing, funding, and promoting social events on campus. They truly cultivate a close-knit community from the start with orientation week and your \"o-week\" family, whom you will meet with weekly during your first year. There are a lot of peer-led activities and peer leadership opportunities so students can receive help and perspectives from their peers on matters that affect them. Overall all I can say is that if you want a school that challenges you in all facets of your life while also looking after and prioritizing your mental, social, and physical well being that Rice is the best university to meet all those needs.",

            "Review": "Rice provides a special college experience. The residential colleges and o-week bring a strong sense of community instantly and often lead to people's social circles and events being heavily centered at their colleges. The student body is fairly small, so you'll often be at least one connection away from new people you meet- very unlike larger state schools. Academics are rigorous but push you to develop strong work habits. Leadership roles are very accessible and make the students here feel very empowered, and the scale of the student body makes you feel like you can really make an impact here. Almost every student you'll meet is unique and intelligent, and I feel like each person I've gotten to know has challenged me to be better in some way with some trait I admire or respect in them. It's been a challenging couple of years and I'm not even done yet, but it's has pushed me to grow as a person more than I ever expected. Who's coming to Rice that isn't ready for a challenge though?",

The Opera Department at Rice University has been one of the best programs in the United States producing incredible singers in the industry for a while now. Financial aid has been decreasing from full rides to having to pay a couple of thousands to attend +fees for a Master of Music. It is case by case, however.\n\nPros: BEAUTIFUL theater that is incredible to sing in, program's very YAP reminiscent (in good and bad ways), world-class faculty, great networking opportunity, masterclasses/private audition opportunities\n\nCons: your soul/free-time belongs to the Opera Department; if a release conflicts with the opera schedule, tough luck; there have been many issues with casting opportunities/favoritism; if you're a person of color, be prepared to be a token on all promo material; TOO many irrelevant time-consuming academics; having a car is a MUST in Houston",

The financial aid is by far one of the best in the country, although they do kick you out a year during your sophomore or junior year. The academic competition is not as crazy as schools like Harvard or Princeton and the coursework is managaeble, provided you plan it out accordingly. Good recreation center/gym. Overall great school with emphasis on smaller class sizes and community (through the famous residential college system, which Rice is known for --- this is why they compare it to Hogwarts!)",

If you've done any reading, you've probably heard of the phrase \"community of care\" - Rice prides itself on having a caring, collaborative environment, and the students, faculty, and staff alike do honestly put in a lot of work to ensuring its more than just a catchphrase. O-Week and the residential college system guarantees that everyone has friends from the moment they step foot on campus; the same spirit of supporting and celebrating each other's successes is not only maintained, but cultivated throughout the year. Despite only being at Rice for a semester, I've already made my best friends here, and have had more of a transformative experience than I could've ever imagined.\n\nTL;DR: what distinguishes Rice from other elite schools is our abundance of traditions and the attitude of compassion that undergirds every faucet of student life.

This is where I was meant to be. I am academically challenged and my curiosity is constantly mirrored in my classmates/friends. The conversations are fun and the people are genuine. Don't think that you can't apply because of how competitive it looks. They really practice the holistic approach and if you bring your unique story, passion, and perspective you have a shot. I didn't have perfect test scores, but I had a great work ethic and passion for what I do. If you want a home away from home- highly recommend!",

I believe a safe social environment is essential for students to thrive academically and socially, and Rice’s value of Community makes this secure environment evident. Specifically, the Indian Students at Rice Club creates an environment where my heritage can be revered and expressed with other Rice students and communities in the Houston area. Along with opportunities to celebrate various cultures, the university’s random assignment system into the residential colleges ensures each college will house a heterogenous family of students growing, learning, and celebrating together. Additionally, Rice’s low student-to-teacher ratio, proximity to the Texas medical center, and clubs for students in pre-medicine create a space for me to interact with students with similar aspirations and provide a solid foundation for my future career in medicine.",

Rice is a super inclusive university, with only the best of the best as professors, and the people here are nicer than any other people I've ever met. Everyone in the student body is willing to get to know you and, as an introvert, I feel myself becoming more and more relaxed when hanging out and talking to other people. Of course, I couldn't mention Rice without mentioning how good their academics are, and as a STEM student the classes are fast-paced yet easy to understand. Rice also has an enormous campus that rivals the Ivies while only having a total enrollment of under 7000 students. This means that dorms are also massive, and the living conditions are sensational.

I'm a happy person, but Rice brings out the worst in me. COVID was awesome, because I got to be involved as little as possible, especially considering that campus has turned into an apocalyptic, everyone-for-themselves COVID blame game. This school cares about their image, not their students. I have hardly received any of the classes I wanted for next semester, and at this point I don't want to go back. In short, it's a career obsessed STEM summer camp hell-hole full of false promises. Forget sports, 5% of the students are social, look forward to huge classes, magisters that don't care, and and impersonal experience.",

            "Review": "I came from a magnet STEM high school in Northern VA (if you're from there, you'll know which one) and originally when I got to Rice I was really unhappy. It almost felt like settling, for a school no one had ever heard of, with CS courses that were even worse than those at my public HS. I was unhappy for 1.5 years, until I toured NE schools and realized the college experience is similar if not worse there. Sure, I still feel like research opportunities for CS are really lacking (seriously, super lacking, only bio-related). But the people here are just unparalleled: having RA's and magisters who care so much about the students, and students who are genuinely always looking out for each other, really humbled me. The diversity here is astounding: coming from a 70% Asian school,Rice has been so pivotal in broadening my world view. The curriculum lacks modernity/prestige but there are still fascinating courses to take if you search for them. I'm a STAT major now & love this school.",

To give a few examples, during my orientation we had to take a “Purity Test”, where we were asked questions about our sex history, such as whether we had ever jacked off with someone else in the room, if we were virgins, had we ever been with two or more people at once. We didn’t have to supply our answers to each specific question but were asked for total scores at the end.\n\nThere was this one tradition where students would wrap this tall tower - one of the residential colleges was in a tower - in toilet paper, which was supposed to be funny apparently because the tower looked like a condom. Or I remember this one event where students were going down the street with a giant paper mache float made to look like a penis, blocking traffic several blocks down. This stuff is funny as a brief family guy gag, not so much in real life.",

The residential college system is very unique and benefits many people, but can be stifling if you don't get along with the people in your college.  The academics can be tough, but the environment is very collaborative instead of competitive.  Houston is a great city, but can be hard to travel around in without a car.",

The campus is really beautiful, and is located right across the Texas Medical Center (TMC), the largest medical center in the world. This gives a lot of wonderful collaborative opportunities for students and faculty. In addition, Rice has a lot of ties to the political, business and engineering scenes. Computer science isn't the best at Rice when compared to UT Austin or other universities, but it's booming. \n\nStudents emphasize academics a lot, but also take time to mingle with people in their residential colleges (a fancy term for dorms and replaces Greek life) and party. Students are usually randomly assigned into 1 of 11 residential colleges, but I was unlucky and was assigned into one that really like partying, so I moved off-campus my junior and senior years.",

If you know without a doubt that you'd like to be an engineer or doctor, Rice could be a good fit for you. Beyond those, you may prefer a university with more options - or less of a negative stigma toward non-STEM majors. Rice does a great job of guiding you through your undergraduate career, but this may come off as patronizing for more independent students. The college system is a good support base, but in practice limits social life to your residential college. The stereotype of students staying \"behind the hedges\" is largely based on fact - students don't typically venture beyond Rice Village (a small plaza next to campus). While they may advertise themselves as a creative, \"unconventional\" university, Rice doesn't cater to a creative student, and you definitely feel the effects of such a small undergraduate population.",

Many students are depressed or suffer from anxiety due to overly stressful classes, students rarely get to explore Houston (which is a shame, considering all the great restaurants and art there is in Houston), and the administration and teachers rarely listen to students’ complaints and suggestions. While there are a sizable number of students that are able to thrive in the very intense environment Rice cultivates, I would say an equally sizable number of students do not. Much of the image of Rice that is portrayed on sites like these is not real. The students, while generally a very nice group, are subvertly competitive, comparing internships and lack of sleep and number of friends and how very, very busy they are.

I was pretty wrong. \n1. Rice students are liars (when it comes to academics). It's not really cool to look like you're studying too hard so everyone will tell you about how easy something is and how you won't need to study. That's when you fail, and those others were hiding off somewhere studying their little booties off to get a perfect score. Unless you're a premed......",

Parking is meh. Campus is beautiful. But there is no way for you to choose your dorm- it's a lottery system and you pay the same price for old dorms built in the 50s with communal bathrooms than you do for the nice dorms. It's not a fair process.\n\n If you want a big university experience and care about sports, then this isn't the place for you.

The administration is trying to improve the atmosphere by limiting the maximum number of credit hours, setting up sexual assault prevention programs, etc., but the student body is hopeless. The students are nice overall but imbalanced, prone to alcoholism on this wet campus, and unable to care for themselves (poor eating/sleeping habits). Combine this immaturity with the grade deflation policies, which limit the number of students who can earn an \"A\" in certain classes to 15%, and students have breakdowns. I wish I had attended a state school with no hyper-competitiveness and normal students.",

While people are smart, the atmosphere is close-knit and not cutthroat, which I've come to realize is hugely important when I hear my friends at other top universities talk about the pressure and competition they suffer through. The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements. Compared to other colleges, there's a lot of freedom with social life/partying and distribution requirements. Overall, the campus is beautiful and quality of life (dorms/food/area) very high. I love Rice and wouldn't go anywhere else!",

As a smaller institution (enrollment of approx 3,000), Rice provides smaller class sizes and direct access/relationships with professors. Over time, this afforded me very close and lasting relationships that I could use for advice, recommendations and greater connection into the community. Additionally, the campus is beautiful.  Dubbed \"behind the hedges\" in Houston, Texas, Rice is loved in the heart of the museum/medical district in a growing metropolitan city. This provides easy access to the arts, sciences and recreations of Houston, while maintaining a large and beautiful campus that feels quiet and insular from the city as well.  Campus housing is great, where students are guaranteed 3 of 4 years housing in modern mixed-sex dormitories. And the campus is large enough to include intramural fields and recreation facilities that take less than 10 minutes to reach from any point on campus.",

The new dorms were nice, spacious, and food was decent.\n\nClasses were intense and workload was heavy, and since pre-meds are everywhere, grade deflation may be practiced at times in some classes, which hurts a bit. Professors were mixed - some were amazing teachers, while others were clearly research-first and didn't know students by name even in <20-person classes. However, the latter were also people I learned a lot with when I started working in labs, so I think it made up for it (small student-to-faculty ratios ensured that anybody who wanted to work in a lab typically got to do it).\n\nAthletics events were a bit quiet, but I still liked to go to them to support our teams; it's just unfortunate that the student body isn't overall into this, so crowds at games other than baseball tend to be small. Our terrible conference affiliation does not help either.",

Overall, I would describe Rice as open-minded, quirky, competitive, supportive, intellectually stimulating, and fun. Due to its size, social structure, and focus on the undergraduate experience, Rice has many of the advantages of liberal arts colleges, but with the added benefits that come with its status as a top research university with resources and opportunities of much larger schools.",

Whether its at a party and someone is looking after you or having pride in your residential college or meeting your professor for lunch to discuss a project, Rice provides a sense of belonging that is almost impossible to find elsewhere.",

The academics are undoubtedly excellent, on par with the Ivies and all the other elite institutions. Our professors run laboratories that engage in groundbreaking research, but this dedication towards research does not prevent them from giving their students their utmost attention. Aside from the academic aspect, Rice provides a warm, welcoming social atmosphere. The students are organized in 11 distinct residential colleges, each with its own special flair. Though there is a spirit of friendly competition between each residential college, in reality, everybody takes care of everybody. I am quite proud to call myself a Rice Owl.",

Each one is planned ahead for with passion and dedication from many students. The students basically run and coordinate the entire experience. It makes it so much fun and awesome. The student life is thus very active and there is so much to do every day. Want a study break from a midterm you and many other students had? It is quick and easy to organize one. Want to help contribute to events happening soon? Organizers are always around to talk to and are happy to use your help. Want better guidance in your academics? Advisors, including student advisors, are looking to help you whenever. It's all about students supporting one another.",

Instead, students choose multiple courses within different broad academic fields to take in addition to their major requirements, meaning that it is easy to explore diverse interests without feeling bogged down by taking required courses not everyone may be interested in. Professors are all experts and most are excellent instructors who are more than happy to meeting with individual students who either need help or want to ask the professor about their field.",

As a great school in a huge city without many other schools, Rice offers the unique opportunity to both find easy employment/internship opportunities nearby and to plug into a great local community. Rice has done a great job recently of promoting community involvement and leadership opportunities, which give students like me a chance to apply our learning to the real world and to pursue all kinds of different interests. My favorite things about Rice are its academic flexibility, its unique and tight-knit social life, and its emphasis on interdisciplinary study/application.",

Otherwise, students are basically left alone.  Campus police doesn't respond to things such as noise complaints but rather contacts students in the dorm designated to deal with these issues.  Furthermore, infractions on the Rice alcohol policy/student code of conduct are dealt with by student-run judiciary processes--as far as university-punishment goes.  Obviously, campus police must take action for legal infractions.",

However, when the drinking gets out of control, the dean puts his foot down.  Last year, after too many hospital transports, the dean implemented a \"hard alcohol\" probation for anyone underage.  Fortunately, that probation has been lifted since students became more responsible.",

It's very easy to find a club or organization supporting anything you're looking for - ethnic student associations, LGBT support, political groups. The only thing is, sometimes students of particular races can be a little cliquey, especially the foreign exchange students. I honestly do not understand why this is, because the community is more welcoming than anywhere else I've been. Most circles of friends are very diverse in themselves.  However, I admit that there are two predominant groups: Asians and white Texans.",

There are only certain instances where they will intervene, and that's usually when you are either jeopardizing safety for yourself or for others.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that Rice is really strict about, is the Honor Code.  If you are reported as to be cheating, you can be tried in front of the Honor Council (this includes any kind of plagiarism, working on assigments/tests with unapproved sources of aid (either books, internet or other people), or even not properly citing quotes and ideas in essays).  Consequences can include academic probation, expulsion, or you may be faced with the choice of leaving rice for a year, and then nothing would go on your record.

However, since more international students are beginning to come to Rice, a lot of the internationals, especially from China and Korea, tend to form their own cliques (although this is not true of all Chinese and Korean students). Athletes, especially the football and basketball players, tend to form their own cliques as well. Other than that, cliques at Rice aren't as common as at other universities.",

            "Review": "At Rice, the emphasis is on quantity over quality. Students take up to 6-7 classes and this takes a huge toll on the quality of the classes: students can't read or study as much for each which takes away from the richness of discussion and engagement. In fact, the students created an uproar when the school tried to reduce the credit limit to address this problem. In that campaign, we saw the worst sides of Rice come together to reveal our more permeating issues. We have sheltered pubescent suburban kids who are pining to attach to a cause and are insecure about their intellect and think crusading to be able to take 20 credit hours will make them seem passionate and smart. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of rote learning here. We have too many pre-meds, engineering students, and international students who come from toxic education systems and this makes the academic environment here very difficult for someone who is learning for the sake of learning. Very rarely do I walk through the commons or servery and hear conversations that are about anything other than the petty happenings around campus. \r\n\r\nIf you want to come here to prepare a neat portfolio of accomplishments, lab experience, and grades for medical school, come. If you want a rich campus culture of discussion and embracing of difference, don't. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual culture of Rice is dead.",

            "Review": "I consider academics at Rice to be too difficult and constantly feel stupid compared to my peers. The community is very nurturing and competitive and students rarely if ever discuss grades, but I find classes incredibly challenging. Though Rice is known more for its innovations in science and math, humanities classes are equally respected in my experience and just as challenging. Students often continue academically-minded work outside of the classroom setting in clubs, research activities or just dinnertime discussion. There is an intellectual air around campus distinct from other equally prestigious but less nerdy schools. Some potential students may find it off-putting, but Rice students love to geek out.\r\n\r\nI'm on the staff for Catalyst, Rice's undergraduate research journal, and help with the ICSJ, a similar journal drawing from Rice and 10 other peer colleges in the US and UK. I'm also in Owlchemy, Rice's chemical society, which has provided some amazing travel/research opportunities and introduced me to some great friends on campus. Whatever academic interests you have, Rice probably has at least two clubs for each and you will be accepted by all.\r\n\r\nRice's size allows for two other nearly unique instances to happen:\r\n\r\n1. the registration process is a BREEZE and students can pretty much get whatever classes they want, but Rice is big enough to offer a huge variety of classes\r\n\r\n2. professors hang out with students all the time outside of classes, giving this rich research university a liberal-arts feel\r\n\r\nDistribution requirements are very lax as well. Rice is probably second only to Brown among top colleges for flexible curriculum requirements. There are 3 distribution areas student must take 4 classes in, at least one of which will be covered by your major. They are humanities (study of things made by humans), social sciences (study of humans) and science/math (study of nature). AP credit can count towards many of these and classes can be taken pass/fail.",

It's a small department but I really love the laid back but still hard-working atmosphere. Rice is very well connected to Houston arts, so it's nice to have that network. Many other majors/schools of study at Rice (like engineering, science, architecture, and music) are, without a doubt, top notch.",

The VADA department concentrations (Studio Art, Film/Photography, Theatre) do not have their own buildings, nor are they even located in one place. Each of the 3 concentrations is split up across campus between buildings such as the Social Sciences building and the lobby of Rice's theatre (yes, I've had class there). The departments themselves are good, particularly Theatre, but with few faculty and few resources. For example, at this time, Theatre has 2 full-time faculty. A new athletic stadium is in talks to be built, but the new arts building, which should have been constructed in the past 5 years, is nowhere to be found. In terms of other arts programs, the Shepherd School of Music resources are only open to music majors, and they have no good classes or ensembles open to non-music majors (99% of campus). Rice has no dance program or department, and the only regularly performing dance group on campus is student-run (Rice Dance Theatre). I have many concerns about finding a job in the arts especially coming from Rice's non-prestigious program, which is why I am also majoring in Math.\r\n \r\nIn addition, Rice offers very few options for majors, and the Humanities and Social Sciences schools are known to not be as rigorous as the school of Engineering. The school of Natural Sciences is hit or miss with its major departments. Rice is great for Architecture and Music, but those students make up 2% of the undergraduate population at most. Rice is mainly a research university, and administration is not focused on undergraduates.",

Professors are eager to answer questions and help you with anything you don't understand. The advising system is great too. There are professors from your field of study assigned to you that you can make appointments with and PAAs (peer academic advisors) that are available anytime for you at your college (which is the community you live in).

The curriculum is very flexible giving students an opportunity to explore different specialties within psychology. What attracted me was that there were so many courses offered in a wide variety of subcategories that I always found something that interested me. The knowledge I gained from these classes has helped me grow individually and challenged my intellect.

The Texas Med Center conducts amazing research and has killer internship opportunities, there are over 20 museums/galleries within walking distance of campus, Rice Village has a great selection of stores and restaurants, Hermann Park is stunningly beautiful with loads of attractions and Rice pays for public transportation around Houston. It is an absolutely ideal environment for a college campus, I cannot imagine a better one.\r\n\r\nThe area around campus is also incredibly safe, even when walking back from Whattaburger at 2am. It is in a protected and affluent part of Houston.",

Houston itself isn't the friendliest city for pedestrians, but Rice's Passport to Houston gives students a free refillable metrocard that makes transportation more convenient. Parking kinda sucks, but only by Rice standards. If you missed the shuttle and don't want to wait 10 minutes for the next one, it only takes 15 minutes to walk from the opposite end of campus to the farthest parking lot. Our campus is very small, and so those 15 minutes are comparatively massive to the 7 minutes it takes to get anywhere else.

A Rice student gets a a top-notch education from a world-class research university. For many students, it'll be one of the hardest things they'll ever do. At the same time, they can take advantage of a social scene that is flourishing, varied, and most importantly, all-inclusive.

The RMC also has plenty of spots to hangout at, though they are most popular with graduate students.

Rice doesn't have a greek life. Instead, everyone incoming freshmen is sorted into houses (think Harry Potter) right before they arrive. Each \"house\" has its own set of initiation rituals, traditions, holidays, songs, mascots, secrets, etc. Its essentially a co-ed fraternity that everyone gets into and therefore has a \"no man left behind\" attitude. As a result, from the moment you kiss mommy goodbye you already have a sense of pride in your residential college and a huge support group.",

They won't pressure you to drink or do things that you don't want to, but you can still do things like go to parties and have a great time.  The absence of Greek life and the strength and community aspect of the residential college system means that students can find their close groups of friends to have fun with, but everyone knows each other well and is friendly and open.  The Greek life system isn't missed here at all; the residential college system definitely defines student life at Rice and should not be overlooked since it isn't common at most other universities.\r\n\r\nAlso, being in Houston is fantastic.  At Rice it doesn't feel like you're in a city since the campus is enclosed and well-kept, but you can just walk across the street, take the Metro, or drive downtown and find countless opportunities--restaurants, parks, museums, zoos, outdoor concerts, etc.  Houston is beautiful and you'll never run out of things to do there!",

Additionally, there is no free parking; the lot that *was* free now charges. Even though it's only $1/day, it's inconvenient that students must adhere to the school's decisions in order to keep the community off of Rice property.\r\nAlso, parking is limited to those who can afford it; many resident students park in the \"off campus\" parking lot because $400 for different inconvenient spot does not seem worth it to them, and the closer you want to park to the colleges (dorms) the more the price increases on those spots.\r\nIt also seems unfair that what few spots students have must be relinquished to visitors and alumni during special events.

From concerts to restaurants, Houston is simply a place you'll never be done exploring. Also, Rice also provides free metro cards, free entrance to the Houston Zoo and Museum of Fine Arts, and etc.",

You get free admission into a large portion of the enormous museum district, and discounts to many of the shows and performances downtown. You can take the metrorail downtown and easily go watch a concert or visit the rodeo; if you have a car, you have even more access to the city around you. And if you like to eat, Houston is perfect for you.",

The nicest facilities are the student recreational center (opened in late 2009) and the new residential colleges (Duncan, McMurtry, Martel, and Wiess). The library is decent. Fondren Library's 6th floor Reading Room has an AMAZING view of the Houston cityscape. The 1st and 2nd floor study areas are nice too. However, it is often difficult to find study space during midterm and final exam periods, but that's probably the case at any university library. However, while I have grown to appreciate the small feel of the student center (RMC), it is in serious need of expansion. The bookstore and convenience store in the RMC need to be much larger.",

About once a week each servery has a special offering such as pho, crepes, cinnamon buns, depending on which servery it is.

The variety is astounding here, and you'll definitely find those vegan/vegetarian options. However, Rice Village is a bit  on the pricy side. If you want cheaper, you can look the other way toward the Medical Center. There are chain restaurants (Chipotle, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Burger King, etc) and a few good non-chain spots as well. But the vegan/vegetarian options aren't as abundant. TL;DR Rice Village has better quality and options, but if you're looking to save money try the Med Center. All in all, I'm not complaining.",

            "Review": "Residential College Dining – Since life at Rice is defined by the residential college system, dining is no different.\r\n\r\nIf you live on campus, you are required to purchase the all-inclusive meal plan, which covers every meal except for Saturday dinner and Sunday breakfast (serveries are closed then).\r\n\r\nThere are four serveries that serve multiple colleges (North, South, West, and East). Sid Rich and Baker have their own serveries. Your meal plan allows you to eat at any of the serveries whenever you wish, although most people choose to eat at their own colleges with their friends. That makes dining a very social experience, I always looked forward to dinners when I knew I was going to see all my friends. Food is only available in the serveries during very restricted times, which means everyone goes to lunch at 12:00 and dinner at 5:30 or 6:00 (and there really aren't classes during those times).\r\n\r\nThere really aren't many food options other than the serveries. Coffeehouse is great, but it is more for snacks than actual food.  There are a few other options, and they all take Tetra, but since you already have the meal plan, they are more for off campus students or if you miss a meal than a substitute for the servery. The system really encourages you to eat in your colleges (which may sound odd, but when you understand residential college life, it makes more sense)\r\n\r\nThe servery food is pretty good, except for on the weekends.",

As it stands, you won't ever go hungry or be forced to eat something you don't like. The staff is friendly, very responsive and will always try to help get what you want. Sometimes the chefs try too hard and end up making something gross with the intention of being fancy, but there is always pretty good pizza/salad/etc as a backup. Healthy eating isn't tough either.",

Each college has its own commons (dining hall), and there are different serveries (cafeterias) that serve food. The big ones are North, West, East, and South.  There are also Sid and Baker serveries. Each servery serves different food options each day; the vegetarian options could be better but there is always something vegetarian to eat, especially at Baker. In addition, the Brochstein Pavilion, operated by Salento Cafe, serves paninis and other upscale cafe food. Finally, you can buy cheap Vietnamese Sandwiches at Valhalla. Most places accept Tetra Points, which come with the meal plan. You automatically get 50 Tetra Points each semester when you have a meal plan, but you can always purchase extra or buy Tetra Points if you don't have a meal plan but want to eat at the serveries.",

            "Review": "College System – The way it works is, as a freshman you are assigned to a particular college which has its own dining hall, student government, faculty 'masters' that live on campus near the dorms... basically it's set up liek the houses in Harry Potter. So as far as meal plans go, you can choose to go to any of the 6 or so dining halls. The halls that feed more than one college usually have more variety and they always have edible food liek pizza, hamburgers, chicken fingers, and a full salad bar, but the smaller serveries usually try to make something a little less ordinary, which either turns out great or horrible. The larger serveries are also more crowded. The TERRIBLE part about dining at Rice is that if you are on campus you have to buy the full meal plan (3 meals a day, 6 days a week) which is expensive and you don't get Saturday dinner. The didning halls are also only open for short times around meals. Theres pretty much no late-night dining options. If you don't live on campus, the partial meal plans are also not very good. You have the choice of buying either 5 meals a week or breasfast and lunch 5 times a week. These plans are basically the same price as buying each meal seperately that day, so they are really pointless. We don't have anything that you can buy say 20 meals a semester and use them whenever you want, so if you have a variable schedule or are only on campus for lunch and/or dinner a few times a week (or semester) you should bring your own food.",

Depending on the residential college and their housing availability, you may get kicked off campus for a year, but all seniors are guaranteed housing and you can usually stay on campus if you really want to since enough people move off campus voluntarily. Every residential college has a different room set-up, but you'll end up living in a double (with one roommate) or single (alone), and your room could be in a suite (common room with several doubles or singles attached). There are very few complaints about housing- they do a great job of pairing you with a roommate freshman year, most doubles/suites have their own bathroom, housing & dining staff cleans the bathroom and takes out the trash, and rooms are very spacious & clean.

Some are most aesthetically pleasing or newer than others, but they all have individual perks/charms which wins over almost all students in the end. Whatever college one is placed into, they pretty much always end up loving it. The sense of camaraderie bred by residential college allows for strong relationships to easily be formed.\r\n\r\nA vast majority of students share a bathroom with one other person (their roommate), though a few places still have bathrooms shared by 4 or rarely 6 (suite style). Freshmen usually get their own bathroom with a roommate though, and the bathrooms are cleaned by staff every other day. My room as a freshman is HUGE, about double the size my room was at home, and has a killer view. Choosing on campus housing varies by residential college but housing is guaranteed for at least 3/4 years and is a very good bargain.",

They are our coed replacement to frats and sororities and everyone has their own. Students tend to identify with there college as much as they do with their university. I was the only person in my school to be accepted into Rice, so I was afraid transitioning into college life would be a lonely experience. However, upon arriving to my residential college, I was treated like a rock star. All of the upper classmen Will Ricers were excited to meet me and the rest of the incoming freshman.

Even after the school year started college events like fun in quad are held often, so that students from the same college can interact.

The newer buildings are of great quality and space, with bathrooms inside rooms or pretty close by, while older buildings may be less spacious, sometimes have pest problems and have floor bathrooms. Social atmosphere is pretty friendly and great; the college commons is a great place to study or hang out. Trampolines, pool tables, table soccer, etc. are pretty much existent in every college, as well as computer labs. Also, serveries are connected to each college commons (and there are six different serveries on campus) so food is pretty close.",

Sid Richardson is the only one thats a tower. Kind of bad living arrangement but cool culture. Lovett is a very ugly building but has good traditions and awesome people. McMurtry and Duncan are the new ones whose most defining feature is being new. Martel is relatively new and the one everyone picks on but honestly they have the best rooms at Rice. Jones is just really far away from everything but a nice college. They try to win Beer Bike and stuff but aren't as good as Will Rice at it. Brown is also just far.

Social interactions are repetitive and require a lot of fakeness to deal with the same people every day. Most colleges kick you off campus for 1 out of your 4 years at Rice, and off campus living is horrendously inconvenient if you do not own a car, and Rice does not help you with living OC. So even though on-campus is more expensive (due to overpriced mandatory meal plan), most people prefer it to off. \r\n\r\nQuality of dorms depends. The two new colleges, Duncan and McMurtry, were built in the last 5 years and are extremely nice. Martel and Wiess also have nice facilities, with common rooms for each suite of about 4 people, and many opportunities for singles. Other colleges, such as Hanszen, Will Rice and Lovett, have terrible facilities in comparison and mean that you must live in a cramped space with 3 other people throughout your time at Rice.",

            "Review": "Off Campus Life Could Be Worse – Most Rice students try to avoid living off campus, because there's always so much going on on campus, especially with the residential college system. However, with our enrollment increasing, there's not enough room for everyone to live on campus, so some of us get kicked off for a year. Luckily, there are some good options for living off campus. You'll want to start looking for housing as soon as possible, especially if you want to live close to campus, but for the most part, you'll be able to find a nice apartment or house to rent. Most people can find very nice, affordable places; imagine living in an apartment three times the size of one a student would live in in New York City, but for a third of the price.",

Since most students aren't from Houston, it can be a little challenging going to look at apartments. Luckily there are tons of places close by, so you can take the Metro rail, walk, bike, or drive. Also, apartments aren't that expensive. A lot of people end up saving money when they live off campus because you don't have to purchase a meal plan (which is required for living on campus).",

            "Review": "Residential Colleges – Rice is very unique because of the residential college system. Similar to Hogwarts in Harry Potter, you are \"sorted\" into your college (or house) where you will remain all four years at Rice. Your college becomes your family and you each college is associated with different faculty members that are there to help you succeed. In very rare cases you can transfer houses, but most students have so much loyalty and pride those instances are uncommon. \r\n\r\nAnother great thing is that everyone WANTS to live on campus. You have a mix of students in all different grades, majors, countries, whatever in every college with little interference. There aren't RA's telling you when to be quiet or turn out your light. You are an adult and are treated like one.\r\n\r\nThe dorms/colleges themselves are pretty awesome. Everyone has bigger rooms than most other colleges and there are a lot of suite style rooms. In most colleges you get a single at least your senior year and sometimes when you're a junior too. Each college is set up differently so it's hard to compare.",

            "Review": "Living Off-Campus – Living off campus is considerably cheaper than living on-campus, and there are many great apartments nearby, as well as houses for rent. Rice is located in a great neighborhood (West University), but the abundance of fancy, sprawling homes means that the nearest apartment complexes are about 1-2 mi away. However,the area is extremely safe. I know many people who regularly bike to and from campus at all times of the day (even 2 am), and none of them have ever felt unsafe. Some apartments even have shuttle services that go to the medical center, which is directly across the street from Rice. Rice also offers many resources for off campus students. There is a website geared toward helping people find houses or apartments to rent, and many dorms have something called an \"Off-campus lounge,\" which is a place for many off-campus students to hang out while they are on campus. The one at my residential college even had a bed, so students who needed to stay really late studying could just sleep on campus. The only drawback to living off-campus is the fact that you may feel less connected to the residential college system on campus, but that situation is really what you make of it. Some students are called \"deep-OC,\" because you never see them on campus at all, but other students spend their entire day hanging out at their residential college, working on homework with friends and eating in the serveries.",

            "Review": "The Residential College System Makes Housing Great – Rice students are sorted into one of eleven different residential colleges the summer before their first year at Rice. They then live at their residential college every year that they are campus. This creates a wonderful sense of family among the members of each college. Each college has its own unique culture that its members fully embrace. As for the rooms themselves, some residential colleges are hall style, while some are suite style. The suite style rooms tend to be a bit nicer, but overall the rooms at all the colleges seem to be nicer than the dorms you'd find at other universities.",
