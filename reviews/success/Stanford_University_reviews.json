When the students going around with their scooters and bicycles no helmet on no light no reflectors day or night. i mean make it fair strict rule for everyone.. even if a car is going 25mph its difficult to navigate through all the annoying roundabouts and tight roads. Now add hundreds of careless pedestrians on 2 wheels. Stanford needs to get their act together and discipline/ticket them too. I will never visit or study here ever",

The motto \"the winds of freedom blow\" perfectly encapsulates the expansive educational opportunities from world class professors to accessible professionals to vast research opportunities. The flexibility of the curriculum made it easy to be explority at any point in my college experience. I also had great opportunity to expand and explore socially and in hobbies with so many clubs and interest groups! I joined an acapella group, grew in my faith in Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, and developed skill and endurance with the Pickleball Club! I would love to see greater opportunities for upperclassmen and lowerclassmen to interact in fun social, non party related, ways. Having a central campus hangout spot with games and activities would be amazing!",

They span rigorous academic endeavors, such as research under the supervision of pioneers of entire fields to engaging passionately with student bodies on campus and the greater bay community, to developing deep, meaningful relationships with peers. 24 hours feels too short to enjoy it all, but that is truly a spoiled problem to have. Despite academics being rigorous and challenging, I feel that there is ample support although, you need to be proactive about it as an individual student.",

As a result, I learned a tremendous amount in academic & social interactions. Stanford provided opportunities to meet world leaders, policy makers, artists, scientists, & people that pushed the envelope in a variety of industries. It allowed me space to grow, change directions, and then supported me once a path was chosen. Financial aid was easy to work with; I had outside scholarships but still had to work on campus. During my daughter's time they offered significant awards to families, which was a huge relief.  \nDue to the qtr system, I took a ton of classes so I double majored. My daughter was Phi Beta Kappa as she also took classes in different disciplines.\nI walked on to athletic teams & by my last year was playing with a US team. That had a significant impact on my life. \nCampus is amazing! 8000 acres with the farm, gardens, museums, hiking, etc.",

Professors are generally great but lean politically one way, limiting viewpoint diversity. As a research-focused institution, one-on-one time with professors is limited, though humanities professors are more approachable. Lecturers are decent, reflecting the research emphasis.\n\nCampus life can be slow, so finding your group is crucial. The campus is huge and beautiful, with great weather and all necessary amenities. The social scene is limited, and Palo Alto, though affluent, is not very exciting. San Francisco and Oakland are 45 minutes to an hour away, offering more entertainment options. However, most students stay on campus due to the distance and heavy workload, contributing to the \"Stanford bubble.\" Overall, Stanford offers great opportunities, but you need to find your niche to make the most of it.",

            "Review": "The academic rigor is what you would expect from a college of this status. Professors are accommodating but still not cover you to do the majority of the work in terms of learning. If you apply yourself you will do well. Free tutoring, office hours and feedback is constantly and consistently available to everyone. Some things that could change is community. There are a lot of students that feel disconnected to everyone around them. Traditions have faded over recent years and stricter policies have limited student engagement. This is a great school, beautiful but not very diverse. Find yourself before you look for someone else.",

            "Review": "The first year at Stanford was incredibly enjoyable, especially for those with intellectual curiosity, given the abundance of opportunities across various interests. While the engineering school is popular, Stanford isn't solely focused on engineering, as confirmed by others not in that field. I particularly appreciate the diverse range of activities available, from engaging extracurriculars and sports to vibrant parties and valuable work opportunities. Personally, I regularly enjoyed activities like surfing at the excellent spots in Santa Cruz, about an hour off-campus, and hiking in the picturesque hills nearby. Questions about controversial topics like the \"prohibited words list\" did come up, but, in reality, it had and continues to have no impact on campus life. Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Stanford to anyone and everyone.",

I did not know until I had already gotten in that it was one of the top academic institutions in the country, if not the world. And that intimidated me, quite frankly. \n\nI'm not the smartest person in the world. I'm pretty much average in terms of intellect and personality. I was actually confused as to how I got into this school. Imposter Syndrome hit me like a truck: \"Would I even be able to hold my own at a school where everyone is gifted? What if I don't belong here?\"\n\nBut then I met my Resident Assistant and my Japanese instructors. A lot of the worries I felt began to crumble. They encouraged me that even those at an institution like Stanford are not always going to excel at everything all of the time. It is perfectly okay to have some setbacks. The important thing, they assured me, was that I learned from those experiences and do better next time.\n\nI didn't expect to go to California for school, but I'm glad I did.",

However, the opportunities on campus only matter as much as you take advantage of them. Like any school, there will be some students in every class that you don't want to be best friends with, but overall it's a great community. Palo Alto is definitely not a college town, though, and the expensive restaurants and old white men bars are not the most fun to go off campus. However, most people don't need to go off campus much, if at all. Everything you need is within the large campus, which is a big bubble, but a special one. Stanford is not immune to common issues at schools like sub-par mental health programs, work-in-progress transparency from the Board and leadership on touchy or divisive issues, etc. However, people are passionate about trying to change it for the better.",

The campus is absolutely beautiful, with stunning architecture and sprawling gardens that make for a peaceful and serene environment to study in.\n\nThe professors were all experts in their fields and incredibly knowledgeable. They pushed us to think critically and creatively, challenging us to go beyond the textbook and truly understand the material. The classes were engaging and interactive, with lots of opportunities for discussion and collaboration.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me about Stanford was the emphasis on interdisciplinary studies. The university encourages students to explore different fields and take classes outside of their major, which I found to be incredibly valuable. It allowed me to broaden my knowledge and perspectives, and I still use the skills I learned in those classes today. This university is amazing and extremely beneficial to your future career",

But, I do think that Stanford could do more to support its humanities departments overall; although the school clearly spends the money and puts the effort into getting excellent faculty, the way that humanities department programs are run could be improved. The programs often don't have 'core' requirements in the same way STEM classes do, and upper level classes don't get treated with the same rigor that STEM classes do.  All of this together made the humanities feel second to STEM, and intellectuality took second place to entrepreneurship.\nAt the end of the day, I enjoyed my time: I made great friends, I loved the campus, I got a good academic foundation, and walked away with a highly sought after degree.",

They also have really good need-based aid for their first-generation and/or low-income students (A.K.A., me!) However, it is only 4 stars because, at an administration level, I believe some changes need to be made. There is not enough being done for marginalized folks or survivors of sexual harassment and assault. Oftentimes, the university overlooks crimes that take place involving these individuals and aims to push them under the rug. In addition, services like CAPS and Sexual Health Education need more funding and to be expanded. They are overflowing with people who need care but there are not enough providers and educators to go around. Moreover, I believe there is a call for Stanford to protect their students as well as faculty, actually showing they care for students' physical, mental, and emotional well-being, not just their success.",

Within a year here, I have already made friends and bonds that I know will last a lifetime. \n\nBecause of the three-quarter system—instead of the semester system—, you get to explore more classes that interest you, which gives you more opportunities to discover what your major might be and to take classes outside your major.\n\nAnother amazing aspect is the food and the dining hall. There are several amazing dining halls on campus that you have access to that offer delicious and healthy food that rivals some professional 5-star restaurants.\n\nOne thing I would change I would like to change is the amount you have to do to join most clubs and groups on campus. While there are many that do not require you to do much to join, the vast majority require you to try out, do long applications and interviews, etc. This prevents a lot of people from pursuing interests and feeling bound to a group, even if they want to leave.",

What I like about Stanford the most, is their diverse community of thinkers from all over the world that always have enriching ideas and experiences to share. It's common to have strange arguments in the dorm halls, but the most memorable to me was \"does being Jewish and gay make someone Kosher?\" I also love fountain hopping or studying late in Huang Engineering basement.",

Everyone is friendly, excited, collaborative, and supportive of all other students, and everyone works hard to make it a diverse and inclusive place. I have met life-long friends while at Stanford. In addition to the community, the academic opportunities and resources are unparalleled. We have incredible professors who are involved in student life and are always available to help. Finally, the extracurricular opportunities are fantastic. Regardless of your interest, there is something that will be related, and all clubs have very open membership policies. These policies help encourage exploration of interests outside the classroom. And makes study life awesome.",

I did not have the opportunity to take a LOA, so for 1.33 years, my Stanford experience was decidedly, not a Stanford one. Online classes can be taken at any person's leisure, and I refuse the notion that the online experience is worth the price of tuition. That time in my life can never be taken back. My major declaration, my spring quarters, Junior Gala, dorm snow trips, time with friends, the bay area, all of it was just gone. That being said, this senior year of mine, has perhaps been the most magical out of anyone who could have ever attended the institution. I made it my mission to foster the most grandiose of communities. Sports, academics, people, friends, all of these things came rushing back, almost like it was my first time on the farm again. Don't get me wrong, I did it myself, but I couldn't have done it anywhere else.",

It wasn't until Spring quarter that I found a solid group of friends (outside of my dorm) that I truly connected with. Then pre-sophomore year, during the SoCo program, I made more friends who I truly adore and have had the best times with – smart, creative, hilarious, very grounded people. We baked cookies and made hot chocolate in the winter, drove to SF a few weekends in a row to hike the hills study over coffee and avocado toast.

Every Monday I would experience a different workshop aimed at teaching key points of what should and shouldn't be done in different branches of journalism. These workshops would also teach you different skills such as graphics, photography, and other multimedia. Every week, I would sign up for an article and throughout the course of the week, I would receive feedback from an editor of the program.",

There is definitely a culture distinct to Stanford University, one which embodies free-spirited, unbounded learning. Aside from academics, though, I'd have to say that what makes Stanford unique is its people. Times when I've felt inspired, moved, and at home, were in moments I shared with others in discussions or conversations, whether it was academic or truly frivolous.",

It has way more resources than many other colleges I know. One downfall of Stanford is its lack of diversity which is apparent not only in student demographics but also staff and professors. Another downfall of Stanford is its destructive relationship with neighboring communities especially cities like East Palo Alto where the population is largely low-income and non-White. Because of tech companies, the layout of Silicon Valley and Stanford's proximity to tech companies, many families are being displaced by recent Stanford grads and other related workers.",

My fears of cramped dorm rooms, dreadful dining hall food, and a drab campus were fully put to rest within my first week of moving in. Beyond that, there has not been a single class that has not enlightened me in some way. The professors are amazing, and their passion for the subject matter is clearly visible throughout every lecture. When your professors are the best in their field, and when they approach every class with the high energy that comes with loving what they're teaching, it's almost impossible to not fall in love with the subject yourself.",

What's special about attending an \"elite\" institution is the number of opportunities available--funding for projects, opportunities to travel for free, opportunities for publication, opportunities to work with leaders in your field and more. If you're looking for opportunity, you will find it at Stanford. What sucks about Stanford is probably what sucks at any other private institution in the country: change is slow, it seems like administrators don't care what students think or want, the financial aid department can ruin your day, there are a ton entitled white, rich kids here who pretend like they're not entitled, white rich kids.

Classes are top-notch. Student life is diverse, and there are many students who are highly smart yet also down-to-earth and unpretentious about it. It's important, however, to keep in mind that Stanford isn't the perfect palm tree academic paradise its brochures try to make it out to be. There are virtually no good food options on campus, and it's quite hard to get off it. Despite being a diverse place, students often go into their little communities, and those often rarely interact. Stanford admin can oscillate between launching programs that are very welcoming to students, and paying lip service to other issues that are important to students. Overall, if you get in, it's definitely cause for celebration. However, if you don't, it's not  like you've missed your one golden chance. Really, don't sweat it too much.",

It isn't how much you know, it is how well you use what you know.

It's not the best situation, but a lot of the criticism also comes from Stanford's own professors and students, so I do still feel relatively safe and supported on campus.",

It also depends on what kind of sorority to rush - there are multi cultural ones, and ones that are part of the national association of sororities. In terms of rowdiness, it varies from group to group. The Greek life here is not the one typically stereotyped in movies.",

Greek life provides much of the social life on campus, though frat parties are open to all and many find other parties they prefer. Those in Greek life love it for the community, the support system, and the extensive network throughout Stanford. 3/7 sororities have houses, and there are 6 housed fraternities. Almost 30% of women are in sororities, and around 20% of men. Stanford tries to downplay it's effect on campus, but the truth is that most social people, though they may find their primary source of fun and community somewhere else, are also involved in a sorority or fraternity",

While Greek orgs do public service events, they are primarily responsible for the social scene on campus. Talking to my friends in Greek life, I feel like rape culture does play a pretty strong role in Greek life, which makes me skeptical. Generally speaking, non-Greeks tend to be fairly opposed to Greek life, but will often go to frat parties, and there's a lot of overlap in social circles. While I'm non-Greek, I have many friends in Greek life, but I don't spent much time at sorority houses, nor would I ever want to rush. It's a big part of campus, but there is certainly no pressure to join; that's true for most things at Stanford. There are too many things going on to be pressured to join any particular scene, unless you have close friends involved.",

It does feel a lot like a franchise, and I think student athletes tend to be a bit isolated from the other students since they spend so much time practicing. But most people respect the athletes, even if there's a bit of stigma suggesting that they're only here because they got recruited. Even so, they do have to keep up with some Stanford classes, even if it's a lighter load. Frosh dorms, though, tend to have athletes scattered throughout them, and it was always fun to go and support dorm mates. My first year I went to see my friend (an Olympic medalist) swim in a competition, another friend (ranked among the top in the nation) pole vault, a few friends play baseball, and a friend play basketball. The football team seems to bring in the most money for the school, so it seems like admin tends to appreciate them most. Going to games is always a great time, and students definitely feel connected to the team for years.",

A lot of people opt to hook up with people from their frosh dorm then get really awkward about it afterwards. If you're looking for hookups, you should be able to find them at parties, a lot of people use Tinder because as a campus we seem to be pretty bad at picking other people up and Tinder removes some of the awkwardness. Some people meet a guy/girl their frosh year then date super seriously, but it seems that everyone has either a) sworn off relationships completely and only does hookups and is terrified of commitment or b) dates someone very seriously for most of the course of their college life.\r\n\r\nThe gay scene is equally bad if not worse. While everyone widely accepts homosexuality/most corners of the sexuality spectrum, most of the gays and lesbians opt to be a part of the lively LGBT community on campus. This is great, except that I have friends who report that its super weird to already know all of the guys on campus you could possibly ever sleep with here on a first-name basis, plus you know all their past hookups, plus its even harder to tread the line between \"we had sex once and now we don't talk\" and \"we're going to be together for the rest of our lives\" there since it tends towards the former. Basically, gay-ness is very accepted, but gay couples are seemingly extremely rare.\r\n\r\nTons of people report being lonely here, despite all the friendliness/outgoingness/social life it can be devastatingly isolating to live here at times.",

Greeks are not viewed in any particularly positive or negative way--if you want to do it, you do it, but if you don't, you don't. It's up to you.

            "Review": "The administration is very lenient about drinking. Basically, they assume that a lot of underage students are going to drink in college no matter what, so they have an open-door policy. That means that if you and your friends are going to drink, leave your door open so the RA can walk by once in  a while and make sure that everyone is okay and drinking responsibly. However, drinking in common areas of dorms is not allowed (drinking in common areas of houses, which are upper-classmen only, is allowed).  Enforcement varies depending on where you live. In freshmen dorms, the RAs tend to watch you more closely and make sure you're being safe. In houses where residents are mostly juniors and seniors, you have more autonomy, because you're expected to be older and wiser by then, and able to self-regulate your drinking. This policy seems to work pretty well, because there are not a lot of alcohol-related problems on campus. The administration is pretty lenient about drug use as well, as long as students aren't clearly using drugs in public places. Stanford has a similar trust-the-student policy when it comes to the academic honor code. Students sign the code saying they won't cheat, and professors are not allowed to be in the room during tests, because they're supposed to trust that students won't cheat. Students are also honor-code bound to report any cheating they see. I haven't seen any cheating in my 3.5 years here. The real law-enforcement bane to students is bike ticketing. Lots of students get tickets from police officers for not stopping at stop signs while riding their bike, or for not using a bike light at night.",

The school has stellar athletes and stellar facilities, which are all located on campus--no need to travel around the town. There are multiple gyms on campus, a rock climbing wall, multiple swimming pools, tennis courts, fields, etc. Some dorms have their own basketball courts, volleyball courts, and grass or turf fields for casual play. The only less appealing thing about Stanford sports is student attendance--there's usually a big crowd at the football and basketball games, but because Stanford students are so busy (academics, clubs, social life, etc.), the attendance at other games leaves something to be desired. There's still a lot of school spirit though; Stanford students love their school!",

Also, it's free to get into to most sporting events, even football games, so that's a big plus. The fan support is definitely highest at the football games, but people do turn out in force for other sports as well, especially if it's a big game. For those of us who aren't gifted enough to play D1 sports, Stanford has a lot of club teams and IM teams that are fun. The club teams can be pretty competitive to join, like men's soccer, and a lot of them are really good, like women's rugby. There are plenty of IM teams as well though if you want to play but aren't as competitive.",

We expect the best from our colleagues in, and out, of the classroom... and on the field/court/etc is no exception. Students attend all home athletic events for free (including football and basketball!) and can often arrange for free tickets and transportation to away events... like Big Game vs. Cal. Fan support for football was significant this year, as we had such a stellar team, and there is always support for dorm-mates on the gymnastics, volleyball, soccer, swimming, and all of the 35 Varsity sports teams. V. athletes are treated very well with trainers, state of the art facilities, education centers etc. Club teams and IMs are also very popular, and frequently win national and local titles. For students, the facilities will be even better by next year. Currently (2011), Stanford offers one large gym (Arrillaga) for all students, staff, faculty etc, and it tends to be overcrowded... however, they are currently breaking ground on a state of the art new gym on the other side of campus. Students can also use the golf course, driving range, swimming pools, climbing wall, basketball courts and dozens of fields around campus, the varsity track and tennis facilities, and the running paths throughout campus. PE classes also let you use varsity-level facilities.",

It is sad because teams like our Women's Basketball team who have consistently fought for national titles has less attendance than a men's basketball game. Not hating our men's team, but I'd go support the team with a better winning record. Furthermore, we don't have a cheer/band program that is great. Our band is hilarious and often the reason why our games are so alive, but our cheer program needs WORK.

Basically, there are students without much fashion sense (some cause they are international students), and furthermore many are so focused on their studies your appearance becomes second. Who can blame them, Stanford requires a cost to have on your resume, and it's often appearance. It doesn't matter though, cause many will have money to pay for beauty (LOL).

The workload is high for some classes, but the grading is fair and the professors and TAs have office hours and are very approachable if you need help. Most of the HumBio classes are in nice buildings as well.\r\n\r\nI was pre-health so I took a lot of other classes as well like chemistry and physics. Chemistry is kind of a mixed bag, some of the teachers are phenomenal but some of them are kind of dry. The grading can really differ from one professor to another in a class, to the point that one might give you an A- and the other a B for the same raw score. Overall though, still not nearly as bad as at some schools where they grade on a strict curve.  The chemistry building is really unattractive, and the lecture halls have no windows which isn't the nicest. The labs upstairs are nice, but a little older. Stanford recently announced plans to renovate the old chem building (currently fenced off) and make it into an undergraduate science building, so maybe chem's facilities will be improving in the future.",

            "Review": "I think Stanford has a really great selection of majors. It may not have as many as some large state schools, but I think what it does have, it does really well. I majored in Human Biology, which is an interdisciplinary major where you take a yearlong course that sets a foundation for the major. It's called the HumBio core, and it consists of an A-side that is focused on biology, and a B-side that is more focused on the human aspect. After or while you take the core, you also take foundation classes that prepare you for your Area of Concentration. You design your own AoC, which has to be ~6 classes and cover at least three departments. You also have to take three upper-level HumBio courses outside of your foundation and AoC courses. Once you have these courses planned out, you have to write up a proposal in order to declare; the proposal explains how your courses fit together, and what career they could prepare you for. You can really make your AoC into just about anything in the realm of HumBio, and that flexibility is great, but can also be daunting. The HumBio building has student advisors who can help you look through binders of past AoCs for inspiration, and help you figure out if the classes you need are going to be offered when you want to take them.\r\n\r\nIf I had to do it all over again I would probably still pick HumBio, but it's definitely important to explore all the possible majors early on in your freshman year. If you get a bad advisor like I did, go to the academic advisor in your freshman residence instead, or sign up for an advising appointment with someone else. Engineering majors require you to plan them out sooner because they generally have more prerequisite classes and more required units.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of cool majors and tracks that you may have to do a little digging to find out about, but chances are you will be able to find something that you really like.",

It takes a lot of lonely weekend nights of catching up on reading, little sleep because you're studying for finals, and projects that will stress you out to the point where you forget to eat. Fortunately the classes didn't get too difficult till my sophomore year so I was able to fully enjoy my freshman year. But now things are really picking up and I've had to put aside a good chunk of my social life. But classes are extremely rewarding and I'm not scared at all of finding a job after I graduate.",

            "Review": "Overall Review – Stanford has incredible academics, as almost anyone will tell you, especially when you go into \"techie\" subjects like engineering, hard sciences or mathematics.  But as with most big name universities most professors are more concerned with their research, so students aren't their main focus.  There are great TAs and section leaders though, so you still get lots of individual attention.  What people dont often talk about though is the heavy conservative leaning in the more fuzzy subjects or social sciences.  Having the Hoover institute on campus really does mark a difference and you'll find that professors and faculty in general tend to be quite opposed to the more liberal notions or \"radical\" ideas.  Especially in the Economics department this can be seen.  If you are looking for a really liberal education, then Stanford is probably not the place to go, it really did fool me!  \r\n\r\nThe workload is intense, and professors generally expect a lot from you, but its generally very useful and there is always somebody willing to help.\r\n\r\nThe one big \"MUST-TAKE\" class at Stanford is Drama180Q.  Despite the name, this class in not a theatre class, it is an introductory seminar on Noam Chomsky and his political and social ideas.  If there is a class that you take at Stanford that will change your life, this is probably it.  The professor, Rush Rehm, is fantastic and very engaging and the class size is usually small, so you get to interact with the whole class a lot.  I highly recommend taking this course!",

Big Sur is awesome.\r\n\r\nIt's very easy to get stuck in the bubble. Try taking the Caltrain to the city, or join the outdoor recreation program so you can go camping in the more beautiful parts of California, or beg someone with a car to take you to the beach.\r\n\r\nGo get off campus though!

Unfortunately, if you're not 21, Palo Alto doesn't offer much in the way of fun things to do. There are a lot of really good restaurants though, along with a couple nearby shopping malls. Also, Stanford offers a handy free shuttle service around town, in case you don't have a car. Mostly students stay on campus, which isn't too bad, considering there are parties, concerts, plays, an art museum, etc.",

Full Moon on the Quad, fountain hopping, assassins, primal scream, scavenger hunt, ski trip, Bay to Breakers, Big Game, Walky Walk, IM sports, midnight breakfast, the LSJUMB, and dressing in rally for random events are just some of the amazing traditions and parties and activities that happen all year.

If you're interested in going in to San Francisco, the CalTrain is a reasonably priced option and runs until fairly late at night.

There is plenty of shopping at the Stanford Mall, and there are lots of restaurants on University Ave and nearby streets, but everything is a bit expensive. The nightlife isn't great, there are only a few bars and the nicest one is probably NOLA. As a senior, you will have senior nights where you can take the free Marguerite shuttle to and from the bars, so that's nice. If you want to get out and explore a city that has more to offer, it takes about an hour to get up to San Francisco on the CalTrain.",

The Caltrain runs from San Francisco through San Jose down to Gilroy and costs $4.75 from Stanford to SJC. To get to SFO you can take the BART.

It makes it very difficult to safely shuttle between dorms when the need arises, unless you know what times you can avoid getting parking tickets($40 a pop!).

I think the extracurricular life at Stanford is especially vibrant. You can find a club for anything... and if you can't, you can easily start one and find others to join you. But there are downsides to this. Since everyone wants to start/lead organizations and host events, they're too busy to go to other events. Stanford students are so spoiled by the huge range of incredible speakers that visit (from Colin Powell to Bill Gates to famous actors) and so over-committed that they will pass up or drop out of once-in-a-lifetime events at a shocking rate. Also, Stanford has gone from \"happiest students\" to \"most stressful school\" in the course of 4 years, and I have personally witnessed how each class of freshmen is more uptight, over-committed, and stressed. As a freshman, I would have given Stanford an \"A\" rating, but now it's s \"B-\". Honestly, most majors in themselves are really not that difficult. Students just stress themselves out by being overachievers (everyone seems to be taking the max 20 units a quarter when you only need 15 per quarter to graduate in 4 years) and overly involved in extracurricular activities. If you can fight getting sucked into this, you'll enjoy all the amazing academic and personal enrichment opportunities that Stanford offers.",

It's a place you can attend and meet some of the most inspiring, hard working, and truly interesting people that can help you become the best scholar and person. You can walk out your dorm room door, walk down the hall and see a computer science genius tapping away Rachmaninoff or have your friend tell you their off to research elephants or visit Antarctica. The secret is that everyone really is savvy in what they have dedicated themselves too and Stanford is savvy in the way they compose their student body. They set up events, programs, and a network that encourages integration of departments and cooperation between students and faculty. They throw freshman into seminars with engineering greats and have cs wizards teach intro level java. There's always an opportunity for the students to get involved; the only complaint students reported (I was at the dinner table with the former president of Stanford) was that there is so much to do that we feel like being here more than four years is necessary to not feel like you didn't forget to try a certain activity; when you choose a group you stay in that group...",

You still have to circle for 10 minutes to find a spot. There are commuter permits, only for employees who live off campus(especially the med school) and these always seem to be in the prime places. Very limited visitor parking and very pricey ($1.25/hour), and enforced 8am to 4pm M-F. Parking is free on weekends EXCEPT where marked in tiny lettering on signs. Stanford must get thousands of dollars every year in tickets, because they are *really* aggressive. I have a friend who parked in a permit spot without a permit for 3 min to turn in a homework assignment, and when he came back he had a ticket.

It definitely has a lot of International Students especially Asia, but the real prize is the diversity of students from all backgrounds providing conversation and understanding in this globalizing world.

            "Review": "Stanford is a gorgeous campus. Our school does pride itself in its beauty, though I think that money could be better used to fund student programs and financial aid. Though I guess the appearance of a campus is important to continue attracting students. Furthermore, the social life is rather dull. Our greek system is not developed like many schools in the south or east coast. Stanford students also don't have extravagent parties, they will have one here and there but that usually involves off-campus students as well. As far as the academic rigour, well its true, its tough but doable. I give Stanford a B-, because though it has great academic standings, its social scene is not all that great, the support I have had has been one that is not fitting to students that come from poverished environments, and finally because there is an overwhelming waste of funds. There are children dying of hunger in countries and students at Stanford take their food for granted and throw a lot away. Stanford has tried to become sustainable and improve on their waste, but it still is a problem. Furthermore, the budget and the fact that so much goes to keeping the campus so nice when some of its employees are not given the pay they deserve for working so hard also disgusts me. I would like to see President Hennessy cleaning the Law School or other Stanford Facilities after-hours and survive with the pay of these employees for a week. Well this is enough, Stanford is my school and I am glad to have come here, but it still has a lot to work on, which is not a bad thing. A lot of schools have a lot to work on, nothing is perfect. The one good note is, Stanford does make the effort to make things better.",

With resources in Student Career Education such as BEAM and the online platform Handshake, Stanford really wants to help its students be fully equipped after graduation.",

Once you have a car, or if you use a delivery service (Doordash, Fluc, etc), you can discover a ton of different options. There's a pretty big variety of cuisines available if you know where to look. Don't just settle for what's on University Ave. One thing about this area in general though: everything is expensive. Food is mostly not college-priced, and a $10 meal is not that easy to come by. However, there is some really good, fairly expensive food nearby. There're lots of different types of cuisine available, including some really good Italian, Mexican, Indian (try Sunnyvale), Chinese (iDumpling) and French. Good food, but a pricey if you're in the Palo Alto area.",

Today for lunch I had samosas, tamarind chutney, rice and tandoori chicken at Stern Dining and it was delicious. Lunch/brunch tend to be the best meals, dinner is usually good but not *as* good as lunch. The dining ambassador program allows students to ask for specific meals/provide input to the dining staff on food, and usually once or twice a quarter one of the dining halls will throw a massive ethnic-themed dinner with really really high quality food. Wilbur has Lunar New Year, FloMo has Diwali, Stern has Dia de los Muertos and Cinco de Mayo, Lagunita has Mardi Gras. We have had a plant-based protein push in the halls this year, which is a bit disappointing for those of us who really really like meat, but there is always AT LEAST one or two meats each meal and one or two non-meat options.",

There are also Late-Nite services in Arillaga and Lagunita dining halls (9pm-2am I think), which offer delicious snacks and meals Sunday-Thursday. If you live in a house (different from a dorm, and only open to upper-classemen), then you will either have a in-house chef who cooks meals just for your house (they're usually quite good, and some houses are famous campus-wide for their food) or house residents will take turns cooking meals for the entire house. Whether you have a chef or are responsible for cooking depends on where you live. \r\n\r\nThere are a few restaurants on campus--Mediterranean, Subway, Starbucks, Treehouse (Mexican/American), The CoHo (coffee and generally healthy meals), The Axe and Palm (wide variety, but famous for its burgers), Coupa Cafe (organic-y/healthy food and great coffee), and a teeny hole-in-the-wall Thai place on the bottom floor of the math building in the main quad, open 11am-2pm M-F, and which looks sketchy but is actually very delicious.

A Boston Market with tasty sandwiches and amazing macaroni and cheese, the ever-popular In & Out Burger, and even the elusive Dairy Queen can be found within a relatively short distance.

You will always find something you like, whether it is at the salad bar, the mexican corner, or the asian buffet, most dining halls cater for all tastes.  There are definitely lots of options for vegetarians and vegans as well.  Stern Hall (generally mexican themed) has the reputation to be the worst dining hall, but even that has a decent selection every day.  Wilbur Hall is great, and their Asian food attracts people from all over campus.  The new dining hall, Arillaga is great as well, and puts a lot of emphasis of healthy dining and on making the food look really nice.  Indian food sunday at FloMo is quite good (as far as western standards go) and if you have friends at the Row, youa re in for a treat (get invited to their dining halls, they have their own chefs and their food is great)!\r\n\r\nThe one must visit place is definitely \"Ike's\" sandwich place in the engineering quad.

Unlike many other colleges where the food options tend to be more fast-food orientated, Stanford has many healthy food options.  The salad bars are great.  There are chicken breast upon request.  Brown rice, roasted vegetables, stiry-fry, fruits, so many options!  Some dining halls may have more variety than others, but overall you are bound to have something nourishing to eat.  This may not apply to more picky individuals though.  There's also a dining hall for people who are allergic to nuts.",

If you're looking for community/vegetarian, live in Columbae. If you're looking for a tight community that focuses on identity, go for an ethnic theme dorm like Ujamaa or Zapata. If you want to live with your Greek house, that's also an option. Frosh tend to have louder, community-oriented dorms. Most spaces are kept pretty clean, and the dorms get renovated fairly frequently. You also have the option of living in an apartment-style housing complex. Drawing in is stressful ('draw'ma), but most Stanford students spend more time outside their dorms than in, so people tend to be okay with what they end up with if they didn't get their top few choices. Overall, I have loved the dorms I've stayed in, and I am grateful to the (underpaid) staff who clean the bathrooms and vacuum the hallways. Many dorms have either dining halls or open kitchens, too, so food is never far away.",

All-freshmen dorms offer an exciting atmosphere, because everyone's new, excited, and eager to make friends. 4-class dorms are a little more subdued (fewer parties usually), but freshmen get the benefit of easy access to advice and guidance from upper-classmen. Most upper-classmen, especially juniors and seniors, live in houses on campus (there are 30-50 people per house). Some are co-ops, which means that residents are responsible for cooking/cleaning, but have a great deal of autonomy over the house (there are no university staff positioned in the house; students have free reign). A more common type of housing, self-ops, offers slightly less autonomy, but things like cooking and cleaning are taken care of by in-house university employees (no need to go to dining halls). There is also apartment-style housing on campus for students who want to live more independently. Generally, housing is spacious compared to other schools, and the buildings are in great condition!",

            "Review": "West Lag Living – I love the rooms in West Lag.  Very room and spacious, although you're very likely to get a triple instead of a double.  Kinda far away geographically from the Quad, where most of the classes are, but if you're taking a lot of classes in the sciences or engineering or chemistry field, you're just a minute or two bike ride away.  Bathrooms are pretty well taken care of for the women.  Love how the shower and toilets are in two different separate rooms.  Social atmosphere is a little bit quieter in West Lag than most of the other dorms since there are no all frosh dorms and only four-year houses or upperclassmen houses only.  But this is great for studying since it's generally more quiet.  Cost is a bit on the pricey side, but it's no different than if you live off campus since the property value for the housing in the immediate area are very very high.  Dining halls are pretty close to the dorms, and you can get to most places either by biking or taking the Margurite (which is free) shuttle to shopping malls and such.  Housing process is great; really easy to adjust and transition into.",

            "Review": "Too Much Money – Housing is guaranteed all four years for undergraduate students, so it's best to stay on campus. Plus, the cost of living in Palo Alto is ridiculously high so it would be very difficult to find affordable housing off campus.",

Some of the other frosh dorms are not so great and have a lot more noise and partying, but it really depends on the dorm. Stanford provides housing for just about any experience, whether Greek, co-op community oriented, themed houses, four class dorms etc. The food is pretty reasonable and it's generally a good experience.",

            "Review": "Being in the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford or, more appropriately, Palo Alto, is extremely expensive. Living of campus is not an idea that most Stanford students entertain, given that we are guaranteed all four years of campus housing, which is really good and varied. Since Stanford is a bike school, parking can be difficult to come by if you are commuting from somewhere off campus since the school isn't really geared that way. Living off campus is a pretty foreign idea to any student.",

            "Review": "Good Choices for Everyone – The dorms for freshman year are pretty standard, although Stanford does offer some theme dorms (ethnic themes, academic programming). After the first year, students are able to pick from a wider variety of housing, including dorms, suites, apartments, frats and sororities, houses, co-ops, etc. The process for housing picks is a complex lottery-type \"draw\", so they do try to make it fair for everyone. As a general rule, campus housing is pretty good, so no one will really get stuck in a bad housing situation.",

            "Review": "VERY PRICEY! Consider where Stanford is located--Northern California, near San Francisco and in Palo Alto. The cost of living in an apartment within a decent distance to campus is much higher than it would be to live on campus (at least while an undergrad). Some times you can get lucky, and the cost can be worth it--the location is beautiful and right next to campus. You wouldn't even need a car.",

The rooms are definitely much larger than average college dorm rooms.  Most of the furniture is pretty new too.  The social atmosphere is wonderful. A unique aspect here is the amount of dorm spirit.  As a freshman, most of the people you meet will be those in your dorm.  Amenities include computer clusters and a dining hall near the dorm.",
