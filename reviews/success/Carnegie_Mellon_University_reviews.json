Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time at CMU as it facilitated my academic, artistic, and personal development in ways not possible had I gone to another school. Being able to receive conservatory training embedded in a research institution was one of my favorite parts about CMU - there is a large breadth of interdisciplinary opportunities and you're able to make friends in multiple fields. The student life is also varied and there is something for everyone. There were a few misses in terms of professors, but by and large, all of my professors were at base-line chill, and invested in your learning and growth. In conclusion, this school is not for everyone (I certainly had to adjust for the first two years), but if you're willing to put the work in, you can make it work for you.",

The work that comes out of here is nothing short of magical. The largest robotics lab in North America is here, the largest NLP lab is here, professors are math and CS superstars  - often becoming billionaires overnight (a professor recently raised $300M for his AI startup at a $1.5B valuation), and this might be the highest concentration of 5x+ AIME qualifiers in the world. Raw intelligence and innovation is CMU in a nutshell, and I feel so patriotic when I think about how incredible the population of the school really is.",

Moving from the bustling, sunny streets of Dubai to the colder, more laid-back vibe of Pittsburgh was a big adjustment. I remember my first snowfall—it was magical but also a stark reminder that I needed better winter gear! Academically, juggling Economics and Statistics with Computer Science is demanding. In my first semester, I pulled my first all-nighter for a CS assignment. It was tough, but the sense of accomplishment was incredible. My professors are supportive, and I've found study groups to be invaluable. Socially, I've connected with international student groups and even joined the Middle Eastern Student Association. We hosted a cultural night that felt like a slice of home, complete with traditional food and music. Overall, the transition has its challenges, but every day at CMU feels like a step towards an exciting future.",

The academics are demanding and challenging, which ultimately creates dedicated, disciplined students, or burnout. Many people require some kind of passion to be here, as it takes passion to get through the intense workload. On the surface, the social life at CMU seems pretty dead. However, after actively looking for clubs, organizations, and student groups, I found there are a lot of opportunities to be part of communities that are passionate and welcoming. I also love that CMU is very invested in their student's success: it is easy to get help from academic advisors, pursue research positions, and take interesting opportunities to get your education outside the classroom.

There are also many perks like free bus passes. It may be apparent, but the workload is sometimes obscene especially for those in STEM. This means there is little to no student life, students are too busy to have lives outside of  work. I am in the humanities so I feel like my workload is not always as crushing as those in STEM, but it is a struggle to balance the workload. My dorm is really nice, but some people are stuck with lower quality dorms; the system for first years' assignments to dorms is completely randomized so this could be unfortunate for some. Many students complain about the food but there is variety and an unconventional system that I really enjoy. The best part of CMU is the professors and faculty. Almost every professor I have had so far is kind, understanding, provides good feedback, and ultimately want their students to succeed.",

In essence, the institution aimed to mold us into leaders and pioneers. Looking back, I think it would have been beneficial to have dedicated career and academic counselors assigned to each student at CMU, providing a support system for us to turn to when facing academic challenges.

            "Review": "I went to CMU for undergraduate and graduate school. As an undergraduate science major, I often had trouble completing my assignments despite being the valedictorian of my high school. Many years later I realized the school was trying to teach us how to problem solve, learn things on our own, and get used to the feeling of being lost.  In another word, they were training us to be leaders and pioneers.  In hindsight, I wish we had career and academic counselors assigned to each student at CMU so we could talk to someone when we were struggling.  \n\nTepper was an entirely difference experience.  It was hard work, but I got excellent career support and I didn't feel as lost as I did at Mellon College of Science.  My Tepper education went a long way in helping me to pass all three levels of CFA exams on my first try.  Thank Goodness!\n\nAfter six years at CMU, I was completely prepared to tackle any projects that came my way.  I guess all that hard work was worth it.",

Some students can come off as arrogant due to the competitive atmosphere.\n\nThe social scene may not match the typical college experience, but it's manageable. Finding your niche and like-minded friends is crucial. Once you do, CMU becomes a place of rich social interactions and memorable moments.\n\nIn the end, CMU is a great place if you're up for academic challenges and can navigate the occasional social complexities. Finding your passion and a supportive group of friends can make it a truly rewarding experience.",

In high school I could get good grades while hardly studying, but at this school I had to sacrifice. I didn't get to do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted to because the workload was very heavy. But, I've definitely seen a tremendous amount of growth these past few years. I'm an engineer, and the main thing we're taught is how to problem solve. Through CMU I have learned how to approach any problem and think critically about strategies I can use to solve it. I've never considered myself \"smart\", but after CMU, I'm a lot more confident in my ability to think (which is important because most things in reality are an actualization of someone's thoughts).\n\nStudent Life:\nThe school is very diverse in terms of the people you'll find. It was very refreshing to be surrounded by such variety.",

As a research institution the academic curriculum challenges you to fully understand the  fundamentals and then build on that knowledge such that you can learn continuously. I had the benefit of being in an interdisciplinary degree program, which gives you the opportunity to experience a lot more of what the university has to offer and set me up well for future success. You get real world experiences through professors who draw upon a lot of their industry experience, and not just academics lecturing you on theoretical subjects. There are also a lot of hands on opportunities through coursework and extracurricular activities on campus. What I felt could be improved while I was on-campus, and I think it is improving, is the engagement of the university administrators, students, and alumni network to build a diverse community of belonging that you can take pride in while on-campus and after graduation.",

The professors helped me learn about topics and perspectives in my field that I never thought of previously. However, the sheer amount of academic resources drowns the amount of athletic resources. Fortunately, a new gym is currently being built to be open by 2024. Additionally, an incredibly difficult thing to change at the school also has to do with the academics, rather the culture of the academics at CMU. The issue with going to a widely-known intellectual school is dealing with the culture of people who constantly stress about lacking intelligence among their peers or the people who carry a hubris with them in and out of class. Although, I would love to see this culture change there is nothing I can do besides adopt or ignore this toxic culture.",

There are lots of generous and helpful people at the university who make the journey more tolerable. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon provides a wide range of services, including in-person peer tutoring, a course center where you get help with homework, and supplemental instruction before exams. Despite the fact that the stress culture here is normalized, the existence of a caring community and the accessibility of beneficial activities ultimately lead to a better overall experience.",

While I also feel academically challenged, this is recently become more of a flaw of  CMU than something I initially wanted when I was a freshman. The peer pressure and academic strain has become a terrifying hinderance on my college experience, and while many top and elite schools have this, the other aspects of college like social life, campus activities, people, and much more are not sufficient enough to create a healthy balance. I've realized many students make either getting an internship at a top technology company or finance firm their entire personality, or many students simply do not want to socialize and only are here for school.",

The curriculums are modern/updated for our times, there is a huge focus on application-based learning through real-world projects and a culture of academic research. All of this works together in helping build bold leaders of tomorrow who know how to use their education, skills and experiences to shape products/services of the future. \n\nSomething I would like to see change is the silo-ed nature of the schools on campus. For example, if you are a student enrolled in the Tepper School of Business, it is often really hard to connect with students in other schools, take their electives or participate in opportunities. A more integrated academic and campus life can improve the student experience and expand the potential to learn.",

I did wish my peers were more politically active and open to having fun, but Carnival usually made up for the lack of parties.\n\nAs a result of CMU's various academic strengths, the student body is very diverse. I rubbed shoulders with coders, designers, architects, scientists, actresses, writers, and a plethora of other people united by their passion for their work. However, this can also lead to a very cliquey and exclusive social environment. If I wasn't attending the College of Fine Arts, I might have had trouble diversifying my social circles without extracurriculars.\n\nTuition wasn't a concern to me, but if it was, I might have been more critical about the ROI, especially as a student in the School of Art. ROI largely depends on what you study at CMU. I know CS graduates are likely making 5-10x of what I currently make.",

However, there were some things that were somewhat disappointing. Some professors did not seem to be particularly engaged with their students. Many are passionate about their fields, but not passionate in teaching. Furthermore, the school is extremely expensive - most of my peers are comparatively well off, but my family has difficulty sending me to this school. It's frustrating when teachers, facilities, and other aspects of the school are somewhat lacking when taken into scope how much we are paying.

The school invited me to their campus for an overnight visit, and my airplane travel was paid for by the school itself. Overall it was a really good experience, and I learned that this school could benefit me if I were to attend.",

However CMU can seem underwhelming compared to the price tag if you have no idea what you're doing. Rating this school out of five stars is preposterous, as it can be either SUPER fantastic, or SUPER disappointing, depending on where you look (more than your typical college/university).",

It is home to 7 distinct colleges undergraduates can choose from including engineering, science, CS, business, fine arts, humanities, and information systems. I belong with the Mellon College of Science (MCS). The cool thing is that I am majoring in Neuroscience through MCS but am also minoring in biomedical engineering through the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT - engineering school), so I am experiencing the best of both colleges. This is only one example of the many interdisciplinary paths you can take here at CMU. Finally, CMU provides its students numerous opportunities to make an impact outside the classroom whether that is through travel-abroad service organizations, athletics, and so much more.

CMU challenges you to grow both in your chosen career path, and as a person. Living with and attending school with people as passionate about both their extracurricular activities and their career path as you are pushes you to be even better, allowing you to do things you never though imaginable. I feel like CMU has made me a more complete, worldly, and well-rounded human being, having been exposed to an incredibly broad variety of ideas, passions, cultures, backgrounds, and stories. CMU is truly a remarkable place.",

Also, you can even create your own major to help you find your career path. I give it a 4/5 star rating though because classes can be really tough, and you feel overwhelmed. However, that also pushes you to learn more. Not only that, you can easily make friends who are very willing to help you with your assignments. The advisors here are helpful to a certain degree.

This said, the work in the quantitative disciplines is absolutely brutal. Most nights are spent working and a lot of socialization happens through working on schoolwork with your classmates.  It costs upwards of $70,000/year to attend CMU if you have no aid, which is a lot of money. So, you work your tail off, but that's kind of what you would expect to get your money's worth. \n\nThe campus is building hundreds of millions of dollars of buildings right now and the business school on the undergraduate level will be second to none in the coming years with its emphasis on quantitative discipline and the ability to overlap with CS courses. \n\nPeople attending CMU need to be self-driven to explore Pittsburgh. It is quite an interesting city once you explore it--particularly for food.",

But the thing is you become a very cruel human being that is only in it for themselves. Theater isn't about that. It is about the entire process and everyone involved. You have to be able to work with everyone and by doing so create relationships that could potentially get you more work. That doesn't necessarily have to just do with the theatre department. That could go go for whatever career interest you go into. Yes they have a great reputation but there is a difference from someone who Major's in Musical Theatre and an artist who truly appreciates it.",

We're finally starting to talk about issues like mental health, diversity, and sexual assault, which is an important starting place, but there's still a lot of work to be done. Nothing about Carnegie Mellon is easy. You don't come here to have fun. You come here because you really want to work to be the best, which you never will be.",

I don't particularly notice the Guy/Girl ratio to be a problem unless you're in a high level robotics or ECE class. The guys are mostly unattractive. That being said, they are all nice and most people are friendly and kind. Everyone is intense and competitive and that serious culture carries over to dating. Girls tend to be more attractive then guys, but almost all attractive girls join sororities (there's a pretty stark contrast). Some girls care about their appearance and some don't, but girls be warned that although they may be nice, CMU guys are generally not that attractive.",

I was a super fan in high school, and my high school did have a lot more spirit than CMU does. However, if we have a team that is doing well and competing for nationals or in a big tournament on campus it is amazing how many people show up to support them. Most of the time the fans are fellow athletes, but we are working on getting more people involved in the athletic community. The great part about CMU is that it isn't like a D1 school where athletes are untouchable, I am friends with people on every team here as well as people in dance groups, theater, anything you can imagine.",

The ratio has been steadily improving (the most recent incoming class had a 55/45 male/female ratio) and students are not ugly by any means. Those that are a bit reclusive aren't very visible as they don't go outside to socialize much. What makes CMU students great for dating, is that everyone is very motivated and interested in what they want to do in college which shows through in their confidence and makes everyone more attractive. Yea they may not look the best, but you'll never really have a dull conversation with a student at Carnegie Mellon",

Attendance is pretty lenient, as many classes do not bother to take roll. Rarely will RAs or campus police bust students for alcohol use in dorms unless it is blatant and noise levels are completely over the top. Visitation is not an issue at all; many students have friends stay with them for a few days in campus housing. Campus police are reasonable, and is out to ensure safety of students rather than prosecute them. In recent years, however, the school has encourage them to crack down on parties on Beeler (the street right across from campus where many students live and parties happen) which has quieted down the house party scene a bit.",

Attractive people are less abundant than elsewhere, but can be found. A positive for some (and negative for others) is the lack of need to dress up for class; it can be as acceptable to wear what you slept in as a blazer and button down. Social life is completely what you make of it. I absolutely love the social life I have forged for myself at CMU. I party when I want to, which has thus far been often, but can just as much enjoy a night in with friends at their house or apartment, or at an on or off campus activity. Greek Life is a huge source of social life, from activities to campus involvement to parties. As far as clubs and organizations go almost anything you can think of is available, and if it isn't it is very easy to start one.\r\nYou can, again, create whatever social life you want to for yourself at CMU, and this includes relationships. Though some girls and guys experience the 'CMU syndrome', whereby they get a bit uppity due to the slimmer selection of attractive people, random hookups, casual dating, and serious relationships are all found for those who seek them.",

Being one of the most expensive schools in the country, economic background may be relatively homogeneous with most students upper middle class and above. However, everyone comes to work hard and pursue promising work, so no one is looked down upon for their economic status. With such a diverse campus (17% international and less than 50% white) it is impossible not to respect every kind of person you come across. My fraternity pledge class of 13 alone represents the US, Canada, Venezuela, Ukraine, India and Kenya as countries of origin. You will have the incredible experience of meeting people from everywhere in the world at this school. I have learned more from interacting with people at Carnegie than I have from classes.",

It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one. It's nice because you can go to frat parties, which can be fun, but it's not a status thing.If you're in one though, it dominates your life.",

It is very refreshing to see, though to those not used to diversity in their hometowns it might come as a culture shock. Students and staff alike will speak a variety of languages across campus and may be willing to share their culture and viewpoints, though it's always important to be polite about this! As many people may not want to talk about one thing or another, no culture is a monolith after all! There are many international students, with a split between South Asian and East Asian, but a smaller percentage of black, latin@, and native American students on campus. There are prejudices between the different races and cultures, but that is inescapable wherever you go. Plus it's liberal enough here that it is not suffocating.",

Though Greek organizations are known for hosting parties on campus, most of the time they can be seen promoting a fundraiser that they are holding or serving the campus and community in a positive way.",

Most people study in Hunt or Wean library, and the school just put up some new study spaces in the university extension. Other students study in empty classrooms, which I like.

Your GPA may not be as beautiful as it was in high school, but you're getting an education from one of the best universities in the nation. You're constantly presented with amazing job opportunities from amazing companies, but you have these opportunities because you're a CMU student and that's enough for them to show interest in you.",

Though what you learn in class may not 100% relate to your career, the school does a very good job of preparing you to work hard for whatever career path you choose. Many offer a 5th year graduate degree to engineering students who maintain a 3.0 for there 4 year program (something that's not too difficult to do) and others looking for programs at other schools have a very good chance of getting in. That being said, the workload can be tough at times and many students have a bad semester or take some time off before figuring out a good balance for themselves. Ultimately, people rebound and become invaluable members of the workforce or research programs they join.",

CS kids love what they do despite the rigor, same for the rest of the majors within cmu. The academic rigor is a part of the experience, and if you don't stay on top of things you can get overwhelmed fairly easily. \r\nThe professors are great most of the time, but you have to communicate with them, even if they're not the best. Study groups are easily formed, but it's almost impossible to find a spot in Hunt library during finals week. I suggest looking for empty classrooms, you get your own blackboard to do problems, and never really have to worry about getting your spot stolen.",

You will work approximately 8 hours a day (8am-4pm or 9am-5pm typically) and will ideally be tasked as if you were an entry level full time employee.  Depending on your home location, you may have to relocate (as did I) to where your job requires you to be or where the main headquarters are.  Most internships pay pretty well, significantly more than minimum wage (2-6 times more than minimum wage).  Internships are moderately competitive.  Having leadership roles such as being a teaching assistant (which I was appointed for a semester) or leadership in student organizations drastically increase your chances of getting an internship.  In addition, having a unique or highly demanded skill will also equally increase your chances.  For example, as an African American, I was offered an interview for the mere fact that I was conversant and savvy in Mandarin Chinese.",

The group members then works together to complete group homework assignments.  This is an excellent component to the class, because in the real world, chemical engineers very often work in project groups with people that they don't know, and the group members are expected to work together to solve a problem.\r\n\r\nFor every homework assignment, the \"group leader\" schedules group meetings, keeps the group on task, and settles any disagreements between group members.  He or she also writes the cover letter for the assignment, which summarizes how the group worked over the course of the week and how each member contributed to the assignment.  The position of \"group leader\" rotates each week so that all group members can experience the role. Furthermore, the groups are re-shuffled halfway through the semester so that students have the opportunity to work in a new group. This course improved my technical skills, teamwork skills, and communication skills.\r\n\r\nIn Thermodynamics, my second Chemical Engineering class, I appreciated that my professor was an excellent teacher.  His explanations were always clear and methodical, and he encouraged students to ask questions if they needed him to re-explain a concept.  Overall, I greatly enjoyed my experience in his class.\r\n\r\nIf I could, I would absolutely choose my major again.  My career goal is to work as a process development chemical engineer.  The Chemical Engineering Sophomore Seminar helped me to determine this career goal, and it helped me to understand all of the career resources at my disposal at Carnegie Mellon.  The Career and Professional Development Center is also a superb resource that helps students to improve their resume and interviewing skills, and obtain career guidance.",

All of the kids that graduated last year got jobs right out of school, and they are at huge companies like Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, etc. CMU is the place for Design.",

If you go to this school, you will find yourself working harder than you ever have before, and you WILL find yourself staying up until 5:00am some nights when your first class is at 9:00am. And as much as it seems to suck at the time, when the semester ends you will realize how much you've learned compared to some of your other friends at other schools and you will be happy for it. Professors are generally very caring toward their students and always happy to help, some even give you their cell phone numbers and will invite you to their house or to lunch. Likewise, your academic adviser, though may sometimes not advise well, will always be there when you need him/her. The only real complaint I have about Academics at CMU is sometimes CMU flaunts how interdisciplinary it is and though often times it really is, it's still hard to double major and minor in things should you major in an engineering discipline, computer science, drama, or some other CFA majors. Your major alone gives you so much work that you find it hard to take classes in other majors. So sometimes I do feel like the University is leaned too far into depth and not enough into breadth.",

It's not too urban like downtown, but not too suburban. It is a very college town since many of our neighbors are other universities.",

It has a plethora of neighborhoods with great culture, amazing food, and an incredibly friendly community if you're willing to go outside of the Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Oakland area. Pittsburgh is a city with a lot of heart and a lot of things to do if you push yourself to get off campus more. Steelers games, Penguins games, and even University of Pittsburgh games are fun to go to. Kennywood, The Strip District, Lawrenceville, Southside, and other districts have tons of things to do. Ontop of that, the music scene in Pittsburgh is as good as any other city its size, large bands often come through on tours for usually less than $20/ticket",

The area surrounding campus is extremely safe, though it would still be wise to use the buddy system. CMU has a program called Safewalk in which volunteers will escort you back to your dorm if you don't feel safe somewhere and are lacking a walking partner. There are shopping opportunities available by bus, though they are generally more than 10 minutes away. Taking time to shop takes planning because of travel time and the unreliable bus schedule.",

Many places are very hard to access without a car. There's no real mall to shop at. There's Walnut Street, with a little selection of stores, that is easy to access by walking or by bus. The Waterfront, which is an hour away, can be accessed by bus as well. Shopping in general seems to be a day trip without a car in Pittsburgh.",

            "Review": "The city of Pittsburgh owns the streets which run through campus, and imposes parking fees on most if not all of them. It is not imperative to own a car to get around campus or Pittsburgh (as city buses are free with student ID), and having a car may be an convenience or burden depending on your needs and where you live. There are usually spots available, if not on the road in one of the parking garages. Permit costs plus city meters can become expensive.",

            "Review": "Pittsburgh weather leads some out of town students to refer to it as \"Shitsburgh\". Summer feels like it extends into mid October, at which point there will be a week where Pittsburgh decides to go from 70 degrees to 30. Western Pennsylvania weather is very volatile, so there are times where it will literally go from 65 and sunny to 25, windy and snowing overnight. The winters are tough, especially on students from warmer climates. So bundle up, scurry between buildings, and/or 'penguin' (walk in a huddled group for shared warmth). Phipps Conservatory, the botanical gardens right next to campus which grant free admission with a student ID, are a nice escape from Pittsburgh weather and schoolwork during the winter, as it maintains temperatures around 70 degrees year round.",

Technology resources are frequently ranked the best in the country, and are the reason why so many of the academic programs are ranked similarly so. You will find technology at CMU you would never imagine. A good example is having a crowd blocking your way between classes because they are watching a robot built by graduate students pull apart an Oreo cookie.",

Though clubbing in Pittsburgh is not huge, there is a substantial bar scene. Pittsburgh is largely a college town, so there are plenty of business geared toward giving college students things to do. Restaurants, bars, stores, and people especially surrounding Oakland (where UPitt and CMU are located) are very college student friendly.",

Printing is certainly convenient in that there is a printing station within a 1-3 minute walk from anywhere on campus.  The computer labs are well equipped with all the software that is necessary for a student to complete his or her tasks.  I would say that having a laptop or personal computer is definitely the preferred option among students since it eliminates the need for students to always be on campus to progress in an assignment requiring a computer.  Having a laptop or personal computer gives the student the luxury of working from home.

The speed is decent and pretty reliable, although when it goes down, everyone's in trouble as a large amount of schoolwork is online or requires online research.  There are several computer labs, some of which are always free (not holding classes) and some are teaching labs.  The labs contain a mix of Macs, Linux, and PCs.  There are printers scattered all over campus, most of them linked to the same wireless printer queue.

If you get a job right out of school (as opposed to going to grad school), it will probably seem easy compared to what you did at school.  One of the great things about CMU is that it encourages mixing science/computers with the arts.  It is not completely unusual to find someone majoring in computer science with a minor in drama.  The computer science program is one of the best in the world.  The arts program is a conservatory (think Juilliard).  If you had to pick one thing that CMU really has going for them, it would be their academic programs.",

It is not a rare sight to see the outside areas completely empty during the day (even on nice days), with the exception of the people trying to sell you things or get you to join their club.  It is possible to be involved in activities and hang out with friends, but if you're looking for a school where you can just have fun all the time, don't go to CMU (unless you find hours and hours of schoolwork fun).  CMU is a great school, don't be discouraged.",

The clusters are sometimes taken for classes, and then you have to go find another one, but there will always be another one.

We only have a few color printers, but they're in central locations so that's not usually a problem. The wireless goes down for a few hours during the worst storms, but most of the time it works great. It's a good idea to have a printer just in case the printing system or the wireless is down that day, but you probably won't need it so a used one would suffice.",

Small school and campus = more teacher attention. My adviser know my by name and my background as well as internship and past. Helpful advisers and a great and talented group of students to work with.",

Most students stay on campus and hate the weather, but there are many great outings to be had at Penguins hockey games, at the many art galleries and museums, parks, and local neighborhoods that make up the bulk of the city. The best way to experience Pittsburgh is through restaurants: check out dive bars on the South Side, get a steak on the North Shore, find delicacies in the Strip District (not a red-light district, but a marketplace), get some kosher pickles and bagels in Squirrel Hill or grab some Italian food in Bloomfield. Don't bet on the neighboring University of Pittsburgh to offer much in terms of social life or sports teams, as CMU students don't seem to spend much time in Oakland, but there is a lot to do down the street in terms of shopping or cheap food. (Lots of restaurants offer half price food after 11pm during the week; organizations make a habit of going). There are hundreds of opportunities to volunteer in Pittsburgh as well, but none are in very close proximity to campus. If you want to be adventurous, there is a lot to do, but you need to become very familiar with the area and public transportation.",

CMU also has a shuttle service to bring students to nearby popular apartments and grocery stores on a very regular schedule.

The National Aviary, plenty of museums and libraries, and one of the world premiere glass art centers are just a couple gems which offer great opportunities for fun and learning. The sports scene is phenomenal, the central hub of some of the widest spread fan bases around. The personality of Pittsburgh's citizens ranges from savvy businessmen to youthful hipsters, but all people have friendly, folksy dispositions (and some of them even speak Pittsburghese).

While late night options aren't great (I hate Skibo Cafe with a passion, and Resnik Cafe isn't good either) there is now a pretty good selection of places to get a tasty, relatively healthy meal during the day. El Gallo de Oro is certainly not Chipotle, but it's bowls and burritos do the job. You can never go wrong with a sandwich for breakfast or lunch at The Exchange and the comfort food section of Resnik offers something different every night, sometimes very good. \r\n\r\nYou definitely get more value out of putting as much money as you can toward Dinex and as little as possible on blocks. After your freshman year, use exclusively Dinex.",

Overall the food quality is ok, but being vegetarian on campus is manageable but sometimes depressing. Many things are cooked on meat-laden surfaces, and you can forget eating most things cooked on a grill. The meal plans are a complete scam, get off them as quickly as possible. CMU's dining style is untraditional- instead of a huge dining hall they have a lot of little places around campus like restaurants that all serve different types of food. Culinart is OK as a food provider, although the quality can vary depending on the day. It's good when you learn what restaurants work for you. But in reality, when the winter hits, everyone just goes to the closest food because it's easiest.",

It's cheaper to pay by cash, in my opinion, because for me, one meal is not worth $10-$11. There is a wide selection, with options like sushi, stir fry, and Indian. However, I find that options at the Underground, Skibo, and the CM Cafe are very unhealthy. I like how they have a small World of Cultures cafe where they change the culture being featured each week. However, the food might not always be good (I definitely recommend the French food). The crepe place is my favorite. I feel like they're always good and the chefs are nice enough to let you replace any ingredients you don't enjoy. Dinex/flex dollars are the best part about the meal plan because you can spend it at La Prima and at Entropy. La Prima has awesome mocha lattes and pastries, but be warned that they usually run out by noon. Tazza d'Oro also has great pastries.",

One common complaint is that meal plans are bi-weekly, and they don't roll over. The biggest problem though, is that you can't get two meals in one block period.  So if you get hungry at 11am, and then 3pm, well, you're screwed. Also, guest passes are something ridiculously scarce like twice a semester. Basically, the rule means that even if you have 20 meals left in the last 3 days of the meal cycle, you can still use 4 max a day (12) , and the rest of your money is blown to smithereens. This isn't uncommon.",

For a good breakfast, try Pamela's Diner (the one shining star in a city of terrible overpriced food).\r\n\r\nFor lunch/dinner, try Eat Unique, Star of India, or maybe Subway if you want something quick.\r\n\r\nFor late night deliveries, CampusFood.com is a godsend.\r\n\r\nFor 24/7 food (that awkward moment between late night and early breakfast), god help you: the only options are 7-11 and McDonald's.",

Also donner is the most laid back dorm because we have a lot of sports players so everyone is much more chill than Mudge (all the ED computer science kids go there), so it seems more uptight based on my experience there. Also Mudge is pretty but you could end up in the basement and those rooms are awful! The worst hall by far is hamershlaug for guys (it's a cinder block of grossness) and morewood (the bathrooms are gross). That's the other thing, donner has REALLY nice bathrooms I was personally shocked when I saw them. Also stevers rooms are incredibly small so if that's what your ok with then it's great cause it has air conditioning which is rare, however you will only need it for two weeks! Anyway based off of visiting all the halls donner is definitely the best option (and no one knows so you will probably get it if it's your first choice!)",

            "Review": "Definitely start searching early if you want off campus housing, but there are really good options available at a very marginal cost, especially if you split a house with a bunch of people. Houses and apartments may be a little run down compared to where you're coming from, but they're all pretty functional and nothing you wouldn't expect to find in the real world. It'll usually save you a little more money at the expense of proximity to the school. Expect to live in Shadyside, Oakland, or Squirrel Hill for good neighborhoods. Landlords tend to be mediocre at best, but are pretty okay if you can get ahold of them. Pittsburgh is very safe, I've never felt threatened anywhere",

There are various options, such as group housing, singles, doubles, and triples, apartment-style housing, and some co-ed options. Some of the housing areas have exercise rooms and printers, which are extremely convenient.

The problem is, it is very difficult to get an off campus apartment that is close by, since CMU is a bit of ways outside downtown Pittsburgh. CMU really needs to build more dorms and renovate the existing ones, but Housing & Dining operations are not very well run here. As an upperclassmen, you have priority choice in dorms but many upperclassmen leave the campus housing system since options are poor.",

The apartment was not modern...at all. We had to buy countless extension cords just to power our laptops, phones TV's etc. However, I love the independence of having you own apartment.
