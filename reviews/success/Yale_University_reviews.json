Students benefit from small class sizes and access to renowned faculty, fostering deep intellectual engagement. The residential college system creates tight-knit communities that enhance social connections and provide mentorship opportunities. While the campus culture is lively, with numerous extracurricular activities, some students express concerns about the drinking culture and the pressure to excel academically, which can lead to stress. Additionally, navigating personal relationships can be challenging for some. Despite these issues, many students appreciate the diversity of thought and background at Yale, contributing to dynamic discussions both in and out of the classroom. Overall, Yale is seen as a transformative experience that shapes students’ identities long after graduation.",

Yale's commitment to sustainability and environmental studies, through its School of the Environment, truly aligns with my passion for addressing global sustainability challenges. The faculty and program offerings are impressive, and I appreciate their focus on real-world impact, especially concerning climate change and resource management.\n\nWhat I particularly like about Yale is its robust support for international students and its emphasis on cross-disciplinary learning. The integration of cutting-edge research with practical solutions to global issues is an aspect that greatly appeals to me.\n\nOne area that could improve is accessibility for applicants from the Global South. While Yale offers numerous opportunities, expanding resources and outreach to potential students from underrepresented regions would further increase diversity",

            "Review": "Aside from the obvious (great academics and professors), there are just so many great resources and opportunities available at Yale. Unfortunately, you don't get any guidance or help accessing them, which makes the already wide gap for first-gen and low-income students even wider despite generous need-based financial aid packages. Also, the university administration is extremely out of touch with the students, and the YPD abuses their power on unparalleled levels both on campus and in the city. The students at Yale are not very socioeconomically diverse (as one would expect) but for the most part very kind despite the prevailing culture of \"maximizing how much work you have to do.\" The food is better than any other college food I've tasted. Unfortunately, most dorms don't have A/C. The surrounding city of New Haven is wonderful, especially once you've exited the radius where shops upcharge you. Student activism continues to make Yale a better place, e.g., improving mental healthcare.",

The diversity provides a campus full of different backgrounds, races, and identities as a whole. Beyond that, Yale gives New Haven a prominent and proud name. Its influence is felt throughout the local area,  and a great example of that is me receiving a full ride Summer Session B scholarship. Being a local to New Haven, I appreciate what Yale brings to the city and those who inhabit it. The education I have received while being here has definitely given me a higher sense of aspiration and thirst for learning.

There are a plethora of resources for students with backgrounds like me, along with resources for the general student population. I like that Yale provides peer tutors for most STEM classes and writing tutors within the residential colleges (Hogwarts Houses) and the library's writing center. Additionally, the professors I've had thus far are wonderful and extremely helpful. They seem like they genuinely want their students to thrive and are willing to take some of their own time to help them. The student community at Yale is amazing and diverse. There is an astounding amount of clubs and activities for students to join, and I'm grateful for the many options I have. The housing at Yale can be hit-or-miss, especially when comparing the new residential colleges with the older ones. However, Yale's residential college system fosters a welcoming and tight-knit community.",

There is definitely a hustle culture here, and sometimes that can feel overwhelming. It is hard not to compare myself to others, especially once I became an upperclassman and the people around me started getting jobs. There are some absurd aspects of going here, like the student body being so rich and from backgrounds with access to a lot of resources. I think some of these weird parts of going to Yale feel so normal because we don't know any different. Financial aid has been generous but there are a lot of aspects of going to school out of state and in a city that are hard financially. There also isn't enough housing for all of the students which I think is a problem considering Yale keeps admitting more people. The students here are generally really nice and there are many avenues for a robust social life.",

            "Review": "Yale has been an amazing experience. The community here is like no other, in part because of the residential colleges, but also because of the university’s emphasis on undergraduate teaching and student resources. World-class professors not only teach all levels of classes, but are very accessible to undergraduates. Every residential college has a head who is an accomplished scholar who lives in the college, and each college has its own dining hall, library, gym, theater/entertainment, and buttery. So it feels like home within the larger university. Most of all, I love student culture which is engaged, passionate, and knows how to have fun.",

Yale rolled out the red carpet during the admitted student days known as Bulldog Days. They had a full schedule of fun and engaging activities to demonstrate to students what life is like. As a parent, we were impressed with the multiple support layers and the welcoming environment. On move-in day, we had an enjoyable experience. Current students came out to cheer and welcome my son. The residential college system is exceptional for the family atmosphere and support. My son picked the right school for him. Yale is a magnificent and magical place.",

Yale gives the opportunity for students to make their academic experience their own through a variety of interesting classes and the initiative for students to embrace and/or in their lives. It is easy to find a club or extra curricular that fits within your interests. I love the amount of singing groups, dance groups, and theatrical groups on campus. I would like to see less of a competitive nature between the students. Sometimes, seeing the people around you continue to strive for higher 24/7 can feel overwhelming and give the unnecessary feeling of needing to catch up.",

It is a place where you will have the opportunity to explore any interest or develop any ability you may desire. It is a place of opportunity like no other and one to take advantage of. But even though there are other schools that could offer similar resources, what makes Yale unique is the holistic experience you will have as a student here. To give an example: I have not spoken to any other Ivy League student who is as overall happy and content in their institution as the students at Yale are. Every single person you meet on campus will tell you the same thing: if you are admitted, Yale should not be just another option. It should be the only choice you consider.",

I loved my four years at Yale and have made life long friends that I truly treasure, not to mention married my partner who also graduated from Yale.

As an engineer, I have especially appreciated the resources offered by the Center of Engineering, Innovation, and Design (CEID) and Tsai City to transform abstract ideas into physical products en route to commercialization.

Like most colleges, there is a lot of independent learning and there are numerous resources to help you. The environment is not competitive unless premed.\nSocial life: Yale has an AMAZING social life compared to other universities of equal caliber. There is always something going on and you can be as social as you want. Social life is nonexistent during midterm season. There are parties, frats, concerts, woads, club formals, and many other events.\nSports: Not a big sports school but many students are involved in club sports.\nYale dining is delicious and healthy!",

The city of New Haven is honestly a great place to spend college because of its urban environment while giving a small town feel. Yale really tries to make sure it feels like home to its students and I feel that it succeeds.",

There are so many undergraduate opportunities and experiences, as well as a diverse student body and faculty, and that gives Yale a unique character.  It is amazing to meet many of the world's leading professionals and academics, and it is an honor to learn from them--and even work with them.   Most of all, Yale is a collaborative environment where the students support each other, rather than compete with each other.",

The academics are top notch in every department with accessible and enthusiastic professors that push their students to achieve greatness. The party scene is incredible and open for students to enjoy on the weekends as a way to connect with others.

There is so much to do in terms of career development, extra-curriculars, and just entertainment in general.

It can be a bit difficult to navigate Yale's website since there are so many and it's not that organized but as long as you google, you can find internships, research labs, etc. Decent food and amazing dining hall staff members. The new residential colleges have amazing dorms (really big) and facilities (being a Paulimur). Pretty good support in terms of career help. There are daily drop-in hour times that offer resume/cover letter help. Lots of different clubs available although most of them have an application process which in my opinion can be slightly annoying.",

The group approach to studying  courses involving math and science can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on how one best learns. The campus is spread throughout an urban city,  so one has to use awareness as navigating an \"open\" campus. Student life is improved by creating bonds with the advisers, deans, and peers that Yale matches one with to avoid isolation. Interest groups also keep one inspired while attaining academic goals. Lastly, dorm life, in general, is good including  gym, laundry facilities and junk food splurge nights.",

Everyone wants the best for each other and grades are not a focus. The social scene at Yale is also great.

Furthermore, there is significant pressure to present yourself as being super happy and ecstatic to be here - and resources/administrative support for mental health issues are very lacking. Classes are good in the humanities, not so great in STEM (I've taken more than one bad math classes!).

Most people in Greek life don't live in the houses (each house only has 7ish rooms), so the people who live in them actually want to. I don't know about the frat rooms, but the upstairs rooms in the sororities are soooo nice.\r\n\r\nGreek life gets really big for freshman after rush at the beginning of second semester. Though most people by the numbers don't rush, a vast majority of people that \"go out\" do. If you life going to frat parties and such during first semester, you might feel left out second semester if you don't rush, if only because all of your friends that do rush will have mixers and semi-formals on the weekends.",

Since the hockey team's been doing so well, I believe there has been high turnout at a lot of those games.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, people follow Yale sports, but I don't think people go to a lot of the games/competitions.\r\n\r\nAs for gym facilities, each residential college has its own small gym, and then Payne Whitney has one of the best gyms in the country.

All parties at Yale are open parties, which is nice so even freshman are guaranteed to have a grand old time. It is easy to go Greek if you want to, the frats are best at throwing late-night mixers that are sometimes fun post-Toads (the off campus club 30 seconds away from your dorm).",

My friends during freshman year have walked across Old Campus with a 30 rack of beer while the officers smiled and wished a good day. This doesn't mean things are out of control. Parties cannot be crazy or insanely loud, since most take place within the dorms and some others are bound to be sleeping or studying. In most residential colleges there are designated party suites and a fund for throwing parties. The master of the college would grant a social fund and allow students to throw registered party (these students would have to be 21 to register). It's a great place to be social.

There isn't much casual dating here, probably because people are so involved both with their academic and extracurricular lives.

There are no restrictions on having overnight guests, and the authorities pretty much look the other way on underage drinking as long as it's in moderation and kept in suites.

Religious tolerance was a huge improvement over my high school, and so that itself has made the environment here feel much better.

That said, there certainly is a high percentage of students from the Northeast, but may be due to the Yale's location (which is, after all, in the Northeast).",

The Spanish department is quite small and nothing special, but it gets the job done and there are plenty of amazing study abroad opportunities, so achieving fluency relatively quickly is not beyond reach. As far as pre-med goes, it is definitely difficult to get A's if you didn't have the same opportunities as others in high school. That said, a lot of people realize after freshman year that pre-med isn't for them, and that eases up the competition for later on. It takes a lot of effort to get into the swing of things and to stay on top of all the requirements, but with a little bit of organization, time management, and the realization that getting a tutor is okay, pre-med at Yale can be conquered. Also, there are TONS of paid research opportunities for pre-meds, which do double duty serving as excellent experiences as well as sources of income.",

Seminars in which you, nine fellow students, and a professor have interesting discussions and heated debates.  Lots of support and help if you need them.  Academics at Yale are as good as advertised.  Yale has changed the way I think in a meaningful and positive way.  Many of Yale's professors are serious, committed, and talented *teachers*, which is rarer than you'd think on elite research campuses.  Great teachers at Yale include Steven Smith (Political Philosophy), Norma Thompson (Humanities), Michael Frame (Mathematics), Mark Johnson (Chemistry), and Edwin Duval (French Literature).  Moreover, when you do have TAs, they're typically quite good.  My Constitutional Law TA, for instance, was a former top-ranked college debater who encouraged us to make arguments about the constitution and challenged us on our ideas.  Oh, and she also baked us brownies.  I should also mention the Directed Studies program for freshman.  It's a year-long, three seminar introduction to Western Civilization, and it's a chance to get great teaching and individual attention from senior faculty starting the first class day of your freshman year.",

You could get away with not having a laptop, but I think it'd be very annoying to be stuck in the labs/libraries to do all your work since everything requires working online or on a computer. No complaints about the internet, and the ITS people are very helpful. Cost of printing can add up quick though.",

I give it a high rating because there are so many ways to take advantage of the sunny days. A walk down Broadway or Chapel, a stroll across the New Haven Green, a hike up East Rock, or simply lying lazily (or studiously) on Old Campus, Cross Campus, or in any of the courtyards. Lots of the colleges have swings or hammocks and patio furniture. The seasons are mostly beautiful--blowing leaves in the fall, first snow in the winter, flowering bulbs and tress in the spring, and shady trees in the summer. There are downsides, like when the snow gets dirty, but building igloos or jumping in leaf piles makes up for it. So I guess what I mean to say is that no matter what the bad days are like, you remember the good times you had in good weather long after you graduate, and the bad weather you mostly forget.",

There are available computers in every library and computer labs in all twelve colleges, so if you have to print something, you sign up for an account (each page is 10 cents at most) and you don't have to walk far. If you finish something in your room, you can just email it to yourself and print it from a computer downstairs in the lab, which is in the basement of the college you live in, so not far at all. And if you're in one of the big libraries, there are computers there as well. Network reliability is good and fast. Wifi is good.

First, town-gown relations remain kind of strained, and that reduces the friendliness of some locals, the ease in arranging student discounts, and the like.  Second, New Haven still suffers from the perception of danger, and some neighborhoods do have a lot of crime.

While it can sometimes be a pain in the butt to get to New Haven from the West Coast, the school itself is in the middle of downtown, and the campus is very dense and walkable.  Buses run throughout, and also offer services to the Medical School and Union Station.  There are, however, a few problems.  Bus frequency is probably too low, especially to Union Station and up Science Hill.  Buses should run no more than ten minutes apart on these routes, preferably less.  While Yale is quite well situated relative to the station for the Metro-North, there is a problem, especially on evenings and weekends, with how the bus service oftentimes is slow to meet arriving trains, and buses frequently have insufficient space to accommodate the many people arriving on campus at once from any given train.  Finally, while this is not a transportation issue per se, there are a number of dangerous intersections and crossings, especially at Elm and York, and Grove and College/Prospect.  Something must be done about these.",

There are a lot of green spaces considering Yale is in a city; there is the requisite idyllic freshman quad with students playing frisbee when it's warm out. Most of the architecture is done in the Gothic style, and the main library, Sterling, was literally modeled in the image of a cathedral. In fact, there are numerous libraries you can choose from to study in, so you never get bored of being in the same place. With the residential college system, you have basically every kind of amenity you could wish for. Each college has its own dining hall and gym, and many have dance studios, theaters, music practice rooms, etc. Most residential colleges have a place called \"the buttery,\" a little cafe where students can get things like milkshakes and mozzarella sticks late at night. The interiors of the colleges (and many buildings) have been recently renovated, so even though the campus looks old-fashioned, everything is up-to-date and in top condition on the inside. As for athletic facilities, we, ironically, have the biggest gymnasium in the world.",

There is campus police, blue phones located all around campus, and Minibuses and security cars that you can call so you dont walk by yourself in a sketchy area. But mainly, most of the attractions are on campus. There is the science peabody museum, the british art gallery, the world renown yale art gallery which will open after 4 years of renovation in December, theaters, etc... If you are into a fine arts, there are regular happenings on campus. Also residential colleges tend to fund and host field trips.

There are history geeks and theater geeks and drunkard geeks and Greek geeks and math geeks and jock geeks etc etc etc. The nice part about that is that even though you can factor out the geek part and find people with your interests, everyone here has at least that in common. We're incredibly driven, passionate people, and that doesn't have to be about schoolwork or politics or saving the environment. There are people who are incredibly passionate about producing plays, or charting the climate conditions in Ecuador, or traveling book salesmen in Victorian America, or playing football, or playing Halo. \r\n\r\nI think the clincher is that we feel at home in this environment, with these people.

Teachers will not coddle you, and the college as a whole does not provide much emotional support. This is not a school where people will hold your hand. The keys to loving Yale for me have been fivefold in spite of this:\r\n\r\n1) My friends. Friends can help make or break a college experience. Studying is all well and good, but at the end of the day, having wonderful people to be with makes any college experience great. I have loved the opportunity to meet and become close to people from all over the world; a lot of my friends are from very different backgrounds than me, but we have a lot in common. This is very refreshing.\r\n2) The classes and educational opportunities. Yale has an astounding array of interesting classes. Shopping period, while sometimes horribly stressful, allows you to explore many classes. Take advantage of that. Yale also has many wonderful educational talks, Master's Teas, etc. If you love to learn, you can be learning new things every day, in interesting ways.\r\n3) The financial aid. Yale gives EXCELLENT financial aid. Enough said.\r\n4) The International Summer Award-Yale gives you money to go abroad one summer. Need I say more? I plan to go next summer.\r\n5) The college experience in general-college is stimulating and challenging, and forces you to grow and become independent in dozens of unexpected ways, as cliche as it sounds. Yale is incredibly stimulating as well as being incredibly challenging, and as such it is an exciting place to spend your college years.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't do all the reading. Learn to skim. It makes things much easier.",

Expensive but convenient since you get three meals a day, and you can choose where on campus you want to eat so location-wise it's convenient too. The meal plan that has less meals a week is probably better since oftentimes you have food events with clubs/organizations or want to try a local restaurant (great places in New Haven) or don't wake up in time for breakfast.",

Sometimes the entrées are just too out there because Yale is attempting to be considerate of all its international students. I don't know whether the food is considered good by the students from whose countries the food comes, but most of the time I personally find it difficult to find entrées I want to eat. That said, there are always other options, such as the grill where students can get made-to-order burgers and veggie burgers. There is also a cereal bar, a dessert bar, a salad bar, and a sandwich/panini bar. Each residential college dining hall has something unique to offer, such as the Morse/Stiles dining hall, which is known for its brick pizza oven. Selections of fruit and vegetables are minimal and rarely change. Yale is very good about being environmentally conscious and serves as much local produce as possible. Additionally, there are always options for students who are vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.\r\nOutside of dining halls, there are multiple cafés where students can grab a quick muffin between classes. (Or if students know they will not have time for lunch, they can order a sack lunch from a dining hall ahead of time, which they can then pick up in the morning). Finally, there is a convenience store where students can buy anything from tea, to frozen meals, to razors, to Ben & Jerry's. The cost is pretty high, though, so for students who are not on the unlimited meal plan, and thus do not earn points for every purchase, shopping at this store is often done only in case of emergency or as a last resort.",

There are definitely a lot of vegetarian/vegan options, as evidenced by there being tofu in some form at almost every meal. There is always a salad bar, cereal bar, and sandwhich-making station, if you don't like what's on the hot menu. Stiles is probably the best dining hall even though it gets really crowded, as it has a pizza oven and wok station.

I've been to a lot of colleges on visits, both before matriculation and afterwards to visit friends, and only a few places compare to Yale Dining. The options are wide and varied, not to mention tasty and wholesome. The only downside is that there is some disparity between the quality of the food at different residential colleges. For example, I would never dare eat at Saybrook or Branford if I wanted a decent dinner. Except for those 2, most others are on par. TD, Silliman, Morse, Stiles have better food than the rest.",

One of the best deals around is the late night special at Miya's sushi.  Miya's is open until 12 or 12:30, and after 10:45 you can get 5 large pieces of gourmet sushi for $5 (also, pitchers of beer are 1/3 off after 10:45).  Right near Miya's there's Mamoun's falafel, which is open very late (2 or 3).  You can eat a meal at Mamoun's for $6-10.  I recommend the chicken kebab.  There's also a semesterly \"Restaurant Week\" during which the best restaurants in New Haven offer prix fixe gourmet meals ($16 lunch/$29 dinner).  It's a great opportunity to check out excellent (but more expensive) restaurants like Ibiza (Spanish), Bentara (Malaysian), the Union League Cafe, (traditional French/gourmet American), and Miso (Japanese) without breaking the bank.  There are also plenty of good sit-down places for a semi-special dinner out with friends ($10-$15/person, walking distance from campus).  I particularly recommend Zaroka (Indian), Thali Too (vegetarian Indian), Pot-Au-Pho (Vietnamese), Great Wall (Chinese), and Est Est Est (pizza).  Finally, for lunch/sandwiches you can go to Atticus Cafe, Book Trader Cafe (both somewhat upscale), or Gourmet Heaven (slightly less expensive).",

I'd recommend living on campus because of how easy it is - eating, doing laundry, working out, meeting with people in your residential college along with your Dean and Master all in the same place is convenient. The off-campus apartment buildings around are also okay.",

            "Review": "The residential college system is amazing. It really gives you a sense of having a family within the larger context of the university. Some of my best friends, the ones I still keep in touch with, are people who were in my college with me. You get, close, and you value the community. Your college Master hosts Master's Teas and other events to enrich the intellectual and recreational life of the community. Your college Dean is your academic adviser, and their office is in the same space as your dorm, so finding help and guidance is really easy.\r\n\r\nEach college has its own dining hall, library, gym, laundry, buttery (late night delicious, greasy food (burgers, cheese fries) counter run by students), TV room, kitchen, game room, study space and other amenities. Each college also has at least one grassy courtyard, where you can play frisbee or relax in the sun. Everything you ever really need is right there. In bad weather, you can get anywhere through the basement and skip going outside at all.\r\n\r\nMost of the colleges are located close to the post office, the good restaurants, and the biggest classroom buildings. Some are further away than others; all of them are far away from all the science buildings. (Except the two new ones, but I don't know anything about what progress has been made with those.)\r\n\r\nEach year, one of the colleges gets renovated, so they are quite up to date. The downside is that there are 12 (soon to be 14) colleges, so you might be in a college whose spaces and amenities are 12 years old. In perspective, that's not very old at all, and these facilities are still awesome, but they do pale in comparison with the super shiny new spaces in the most recently renovated ones.",

All Yale undergraduates are members of one of the twelve colleges and they live, eat, compete in intramural sports, and much more with the members of their college.

Each of the colleges also has its own unique facilities such as underground theaters, wood shops, basketball courts, pottery studios, movie rooms, etc. All colleges have their own master and dean who are responsible for the well-being of the students in their college, and who plan special events or outings for the students. All in all, the residential colleges provide a truly wonderful experience, and students have a lot of pride in their colleges.\r\n\r\nAs for actual living spaces, Yale students live in spacious, newly renovated suites, all of which have large common rooms.

There are no RAs knocking on your door (the only thing there is that's sort of similar to an RA is a 'freshman counselor but that's only your first year!) and generally if you register a party with your master then you won't have any issues (unless it's excessively loud and past quiet hours).

There are halls like Bingham that have spacious suites (especially the 9th floor suites) and then there's L-dub that houses students in obscenely small rooms. There are people who love their suitemates and couldn't have asked for group of people to live with and others who dislike their suitemates immensely. I have been fortunate enough to be matched with really great suitemates and really spacious housing, hence the A+ rating. The facilities seem to work fine in all freshman housing, I haven't heard too many complaints about the bathrooms or laundry rooms. If any of washing machines or dryers malfunction, it's usually fixed by the next day. It's pretty easy to socialize with other suites. I love Bingham because the Chaplain's Office in the basement has free ice cream everyday!",

            "Review": "Nobody can quite grasp how breathtaking the campus housing is until they visit. Every single friend and prefrosh that visited the campus and stayed with me in the dorms have literally had jaw-dropping moments. It is not only the spaciousness of the dorm rooms and common rooms, but the cleanliness and amenities that follow. In-suite bathrooms are common, which means only about 4-6 people share the showers, toilets, and sinks. All 12 colleges have been renovated so the facilities like game rooms, butteries, gyms, libraries are in top shape. The facilities managers do a great job with the upkeep so that nothing is rundown. I feel incredibly lucky every day to dwell in such great housing.",

            "Review": "The off-campus housing is a bit of a hassle because it's hard finding a decent place at an okay price. Also, you can't live off-campus until your junior year anyway. Plus the residential colleges are nice and convenient and guaranteed closer to classes and dinning halls (which every residential college has). The only reason that it might be beneficial to live off-campus is if you were planning on living there all year round or if you didn't want to be on the meal plan (which is required if living on campus).",

            "Review": "Beautiful Residential Colleges With Common Rooms – All of the residential colleges are beautiful, inside and out.  Most freshman are housed on Old Campus, where rooms are a bit smaller (especially in Lanman-Wright), but they're gorgeous compared to a lot of other schools.  Most are two bedrooms, with two people each, plus a common room.  Some dorms have combinations of singles and doubles (or just singles) with common rooms, and singles increase as you are an upperclassman.\r\n\r\nThe residential college system is amazing and wonderful.  It really seems to work the way it's supposed to.",

            "Review": "Distinctly Underwhelming – For all the fuss about the quality of Yale's housing, I simply don't rate it. Freshman dorms are universally mediocre to poor; expect to be sharing a bathroom with six or seven others, and expect outdated rooms that haven't been refurbished in years. Farnam, Durfee, Lawrance and Welch are the best, but still aren't impressive, whilst Vanderbilt is refurbished but tiny. Bingham is mixed, and Lanman-Wright unacceptable. College housing is better, but that isn't saying much: there are far too many doubles throughout. Many justify the housing by saying that other places have it worse; I don't doubt that, but that doesn't make Yale's facilities good.\r\n\r\nIf Yale stopped pretending that its housing was fantastic, perhaps it could improve it. Living environment is integral to personal happiness, and for over $55,000 a year I simply expect better.",

            "Review": "It's Pretty Sweet – The housing itself at Yale is phenomenal. It's almost all suite style, which means you and generally 3 to 5 other people (but there are suites as big as 12 people, and as small as 2) will have a few doubles and singles connected to a common room. If you have a larger suite (7 people or greater) you'll generally have your own bathroom inside of it. Overall the suites are pretty nice, and it's a great style of housing. Having a single is a good deal.\r\n\r\nThe only downside (as I view it, others love this) is the residential college system. Students are affiliated with a residential college for the duration of the 4 years they spend here. You will be living only with people who are in your college unless you elect to live off campus. Make a good group of friends in other colleges? That sucks. You can't live with them unless you all go through the hassle of changing your residential college affiliation (which will probably alienate the people you've been living with and bonding with during your freshman year).\r\n\r\nHowever, rant aside, the housing is great.",
